    Under the Plug & Play architecture, if all add-in cards are  Plug  &  Play
    compatible, no resource conflicts should occur.  In practice, problems can
    still occur; although less frequently than with legacy ISA bus cards,  and
    primarily on the earliest PCI compatible motherboards.


    1.B  ISA Card Interference

    The  computer's Plug & Play system can perform conflict free configuration
    only if all add-in cards are Plug & Play; presence of an ISA  legacy  card
    can't  be  detected  by Plug & Play, and resources used by the legacy card
    may be reassigned.  The conflicting resource is often an interrupt  (IRQ).
    Computers  with  support  for both Plug & Play and legacy ISA card's typi-
    cally have BIOS Setup options such as:

             IRQ 10  Used/Available
             IRQ 11  Used/Available

    These allow manually marking as `Used' for all IRQ's utilized  by  an  ISA
    card; any IRQ's not so marked may be assigned and/or shared among the Plug
    & Play cards.  (Circa 1995?)


    1.C  Insufficient Resources

    The Plug & Play system is designed to automatically assign resources in  a
    non-conflicting  manner.   However, resources are still limited, and there
    is no guarantee that every card  will  have  its  requirements  fulfilled.
    Systems  differ in how they notify the user of insufficient resources.  If
    a Plug & Play card can't be detected by its software, try  removing  other
    Plug & Play cards to free various resources.  (Circa 1995?)


    1.D  PCI Express Card not Found on Fast Booting Computers

    The  PIXCI(R)  A110,  A310,  D3XE,  E1, E1DB, EB1, EB1-PoCL, EB1mini, EC1,
    ECB1, ECB1-34, ECB2, EL1 (x1 gen1 version), EL1DB (x1 gen1 version),  SI1,
    SI2,  SV7,  and  SV8  frame grabbers, and PIXCI(R)E EB1tg frame generator,
    require a fraction of a second to initialize after power up, before it can
    identify  itself to the operating system.  On some fast-booting computers,
    the operating system may not see the  card,  and  won't  load  the  card's
    driver.

    On  some computers, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber may not be detected after a
    `hard' reboot (cycling computer power),  but  will  be  detected  after  a
    `soft' reboot (without cycling computer power).  On some others, the frame
    grabbers will not be detected even after a soft reboot.

    Power  Options)  will  allow  detection  after a hard reboot.  (circa Jan.
    2017).

                           2.  Drivers and Plug & Play






    2.A  PCI/PCIe Vendor and Device ID Conflict

    The Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, and 11 Plug & Play uti-
    lizes  a PCI/PCIe card's Vendor and Device ID to select a driver and asso-
    ciate the driver with a card.  The DOS and Windows NT operating systems do
    not select a driver via Plug & Play, but rather the loaded driver searches
    for eligible and compatible cards.  The PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5, SV5A,
    SV5B,  SV5L,  and  SV6 frame grabbers share their PCI Vendor and Device ID
    with other cards, by other manufacturers,  which  use  similar  multimedia
    chipsets.  This may cause confusion under any of those operating systems.

    The  PIXCI(R) driver may be associated with a non-PIXCI card.  Attempts by
    XCIP or XCAP software to open non-PIXCI multimedia cards, which the  PIXCI
    driver  interprets  as a PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5, SV5A, SV5B, SV5L, or
    SV6, typically results in a  `Can't  access  18V8/16LV8'  error.   If  the
    PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber(s) are removed and the same error occurs, then it
    is almost certain that other cards using similar multimedia  chipsets  are
    present.

    Alternately,  a  non-PIXCI  driver may be associated with a PIXCI(R) frame
    grabber.  Under Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, 7,  8,  10,  and  11,
    only  one  driver  can be associated with a card and XCIP or XCAP software
    will therefore not be able to open the PIXCI(R) frame grabber;  a  typical
    error is `Driver not installed ... or frame grabber not installed'.  Under
    Linux, both drivers may have the frame grabber open, but interrupts  (IRQ)
    may  not  occur;  or,  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber  driver  may report a
    `DDrequest_(mem)_region' error,  if  the  multimedia  driver  has  already
    opened the PIXCI(R) frame grabber.


    2.B  Windows 2000, XP Error: 'Drivers Not Installed'

    If  in  response  to Windows initial detection of a PIXCI(R) frame grabber
    and subsequent query for a driver, Windows 2000, or XP finds a Windows  95
    or  98  driver, that driver will be loaded but not work properly.  Windows
    2000, and XP will no longer query about loading PIXCI(R) drivers, but  the
    Device  Manager will report that drivers are not installed, typically with
    an error code of `28'.

    To remedy: a) Delete the system copies of the PIXCI(R) driver's  .inf  and
    .pnf  files,  b) Using the Device Manager, uninstall the driver associated
    with the PIXCI(R) entry, c) Using the XCAP Driver Assistant, uninstall the
    PIXCI(R)  driver,  d) Reboot,  or using the Device Manager initiate a scan

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    for hardware changes, e) When  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber  is  detected
    advise Windows that a specific driver `location' will be specified, but do
    not select CDROM, f) Specify the location as the  DRIVERS\WIN2K  or  DRIV-
    ERS\WINXP folder under the XCAP installation folder, g) Reboot.


    2.C  Windows 2000, XP Error: 'Invalid Data'

    On  some  Windows  2000  and  XP  Dell  systems, after Windows Plug & Play
    detects the PIXCI(R) frame grabber and queries for a driver, Plug  &  Play
    may  report  an  `Invalid Data' error.  This occurs when Windows has erro-
    neously marked the PCI/PCIe slot in the registry as `READ ONLY'.

    To remedy: (a) Click Start,  Run,  and  `regedt32'  (using  the  alternate
    `regedit' editor will NOT work).  (b) Navigate to:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\ENUM\PCI

    (c) Select  a VEN_xxxx&DEV_xxxx..  entry which corresponds to the PIXCI(R)
    frame grabber being used (see list above).   (d) Right  click  and  select
    `Permissions'.   (e) Click  `Allow'.  (f) Close regedt32 and continue with
    driver installation (i.e. Start, System, Control Panel, Add New  Hardware,
    etc.).


    2.D  Windows XP Error: 'Required section was not found in the INF'

    Under  some  Windows  XP  installations,  attempts to install the PIXCI(R)
    driver result in a Windows `Required section was not  found  in  the  INF'
    error.   This  is not a PIXCI(R) specific problem.  A Windows registry key
    is missing, namely:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{6BDD1FC6-810F-11D0-BEC7-08002BE2092F}

    (Circa 2005?)


    2.E  Windows XP Error: 'The class installer has denied the request to
         install or upgrade this device'

    Under Windows XP, attempts to install the PIXCI(R) driver result in a Win-
    dows  `The  class  installer  has denied the request to install or upgrade
    this device' error.  This is not a PIXCI(R) specific problem.   The  error
    is  typically  caused by a computer virus attacking and modifying the Win-
    dows registry.  The virus may still be present, or the virus may have been
    destroyed; but the effects of the changes to the registry remain.

    PIXCI(R) driver.  XCAP's PIXCI, PIXCI Open/Close, Driver Assistant,  Unin-

    2.F  Windows 8/10/11: Shutdown versus Restart

    After installing a driver, installing an updated driver, or changing frame
    buffer memory allocation settings, under Windows 8, 10, or  11,  the  sys-
    tem's  Restart, not Shutdown, must be used for the changes to have effect!
    (Circa 04-Dec-2012).


    2.G  Windows 8/10/11 Error: 'Drivers Not Installed' or 'Frame Grabber not
         Found'

    XCAP/XCLIB  V3.8  software  reports  that  the  PIXCI(R)  driver  is   not
    installed,  but  the  Windows  Device Manager shows that the V3.8 PIXCI(R)
    driver is installed and working properly.

    A change was made to the driver so as  to  pass  Microsoft's  verifier.exe
    tests regarding `style' issues; previous versions of the driver used older
    kernel API functions that the verifier  found  objectionable.   The  newer
    driver  requires use of a newer XCAP/XCLIB DLL; the newer DLL is backwards
    compatible can can operate with the older driver.

    Either update to a newer release of the XCAP/XCLIB V3.8 software.  Or  set
    the `Windows' Symbolic Link for V3.8.0 Driver Compatibility' option (XCAP,
    PIXCI, PIXCI Open/Close, Advanced) so that the driver operates in  a  com-
    patibility mode.  (Circa May 2015)


    2.H  Windows 10 Error: 'Drivers Not Installed' or 'Frame Grabber not
         Found'

    XCAP/XCLIB software reports that the PIXCI(R) driver is not installed, but
    the Windows Device Manager reports that the PIXCI(R) driver  is  installed
    and working properly.

    On  Windows  10,  the  Windows  Device  Manager, after installing PIXCI(R)
    driver, doesn't always prompt for  Windows  to  be  restarted;  rather  it
    incorrectly  reports  that the driver is working normally.  (This has only
    been observed under unusual circumstances; such as after using the  Device
    Manager  to  explicitly  uninstall  the  PIXCI(R) frame grabber, and then,
    later, restart Windows, find the PIXCI(R) frame grabber, and reinstall the
    driver).

    Restart Windows to resolve problem.  (Circa Feb 2022)

    2.I  PCIe/104 Error: 'Drivers Not Installed' or 'Frame Grabber not Found'

    PCIe/104 slots can be configured in two different ways: a) As one x16 bus,
    or b) As bifurcated into two x8 buses.  The PIXCI(R) e104x4  requires  the
    bifurcated configuration.  If the bus is not bifurcated, the frame grabber
    might not be detected by the  operating  system,  or  additional  PCIe/104

    2.J  Windows Vista/7: Invalid Driver Digital Signature & Error Code 52

    Microsoft has changed the behavior of Windows 7 and later so as to require
    the new SHA-2 style digital signature on any driver  which  is  dated  Jan
    2016  or  later.   The  Windows  Device  Manager may report `code 52' if a
    driver with an incorrect signature is installed.

    EPIX, Inc. now supplies drivers with both SHA-1 and SHA-2  signatures,  as
    well  as  supplying  drivers signed only with SHA-1 for compatibility with
    older systems.

    However, Windows 7 may require an update to use drivers signed with SHA-2;
    see Microsoft's:

             Microsoft Security Advisory 2949927
             Microsoft Security Advisory 3033929

    Windows Vista may also require an update; see:

             Microsoft Article ID 2763674

    Synopsis:  Updating  Windows with all Service Packs is necessary for reli-
    able loading of any drivers dated Jan 2016 or later.  (Circa 2016)


    2.K  Windows 10/11 64-Bit: Driver Digital Signature & Error Code 52

    Newer releases of Windows 10 64-bit require  drivers  to  be  signed  with
    Extended  Validation  (EV) signatures and countersigned by Microsoft.  The
    Windows Device Manager may report `code 52' if a driver with an  incorrect
    signature is installed.

    PIXCI(R)  drivers  released  April 2017 comply with these requirements for
    desktop operating systems.

    Older drivers can be used by disabling Windows'  requirements  for  signa-
    tures, such as via:



             bcdedit /set TESTSIGNING ON

    or  by  holding  left-shift while clicking restart, then (after navigating
    through several screens, accessing `Driver Signature Enforcement'.

    Windows 11 has the same requirements for Extended Validation  (EV)  signa-
    tures.  (Circa 2017, 07-Oct-2021)


    2.L  Windows 10/11 64-Bit: Driver Digital Signature & Error Code 52

    Newer releases of Windows 10 64-Bit, and Windows 11, require drivers to be
    signed with Extended Validation (EV) signatures and countersigned  by  Mi-
    crosoft.  The Windows Device Manager may report `code 52' if a driver with
    an incorrect signature is installed.

    Use the Windows file browser and check the digital signature of:

             c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\epixxc6.sys

    under its Properties.  The driver should be signed by EPIX, Inc. and coun-
    tersigned by Microsoft.

    Under some conditions, early releases of Windows 10 may incorrectly report
    a driver's valid signature as invalid; update  Windows  with  all  Service
    Packs.

    A driver for an older version of Windows, using a different digital signa-
    ture, may have been installed; this may happen if,  on  initial  installa-
    tion,  the  Device Manager is allowed to search for a driver and selects a
    driver with, perhaps, Windows 7 style signatures.  Use the Device Manager,
    select  the  PIXCI(R) imaging device, `Properties', `Driver', click `Unin-
    stall Device', and restart Windows.  The Device Manager should prompt  for
    a driver; do not let it search, instead point it to:

             c:\Program Files\...\EPIX\XCAP\Drivers\Win11x64

    or

             c:\Program Files\...\EPIX\XCAP\Drivers\Win10x64

    (The  actual  path may vary depending on Windows configuration and options
    used when installing XCAP; if necessary, use  Windows'  File  Explorer  to
    search for `XCAP').  (Circa 26-Jul-2018, 07-Oct-2021)

                          3.  PCI/PCIe Interrupts (IRQ)






    3.A  IRQ Sharing

    The  Plug  &  Play  system may assign multiple PCI/PCIe cards to share the
    same interrupt.  Depending on the characteristics of  the  two  (or  more)
    devices  sharing  an  interrupt,  and  the characteristics of the selected
    operating system, one or both devices may always work, may never work,  or
    may work intermittently.

    IRQ  sharing  is  a concern for cards using the older PCI bus w. IRQ pins,
    but not for PCI Express using its Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI).

    Test for IRQ sharing by using XCAP:

            PIXCI(R)
            PIXCI(R) Open/Close
            Advanced
            Allow Shared IRQ: Uncheck
            OK
            Open

    If the Open succeeds, then the IRQ was not being shared.  If the Open does
    not  succeed  and  a `Configuration Error or Fault' dialog is shown with a
    message such as `Bad or conflicting IRQ', then the IRQ  was  being  shared
    with  another  device.   This tests for conflict, but does not resolve the
    conflict.

    IRQ sharing may or may  not  work,  depending  upon  the  various  devices
    involved.   On  some motherboards, IRQs are assigned by physical slot; try
    moving the PIXCI(R) frame grabber to a different slot.  On  other  mother-
    boards, the BIOS Setup may allow assigning IRQs to different slots; or may
    at least allow specifying which IRQ's are to be parceled out  amongst  all
    slots.

                  4.  PCI/PCIe Bus Master (DMA) & Bus Bandwidth






    4.A  Bus Mastering

    Imaging  boards without on-board memory use PCI/PCIe bus master mode (i.e.
    DMA) to transfer image data to the PC's memory in real time.   The  avail-
    able  bandwidth  of PCI/PCIe motherboards differs widely; not all PCI/PCIe
    motherboards can support continuous, full field, real time capture into PC
    memory.

    Some  motherboards  may  not support Bus Mastering in every PCI/PCIe slot;
    the motherboard's documentation should describe which slots may  be  used.
    Also,  some older motherboards may have PCI/PCIe slots, but are not Plug &
    Play compatible; the BIOS Setup screens may  require  manual  enabling  of
    master mode and assignment of IRQ's for each PCI/PCIe slot:

             Device Select:      Slot 0
             Enable Device:      Enabled
             Enable Master:      Enabled
             Device IRQ Line:    IRQ 11

    Older  motherboards  may initialize with PCI Burst Mode deactivated; other
    motherboards may not support PCI Burst Mode at all.   PCI  Burst  Mode  is
    critical to utilizing the full bandwidth of the PCI bus.  Some versions of
    BIOS Setup allow enabling PCI Burst Mode:

             PCI Burst Mode      Enabled

    Older graphic display (S/VGA) cards may not operate  properly  with  Burst
    Mode  enabled;  consult  the graphic display (S/VGA) card manufacturer for
    updated drivers which allow use of Burst Mode.  (Circa 1995?)

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    The PIXCI(R) PCI Express and ExpressCard frame grabbers (D3XE,  E1,  E1DB,
    E4,   E4DB,  E4G2-2F,  E4G2-4B,  E4G2-F2B,  E8,  E8CAM,  E8DB,  e104x4-2f,
    e104x4-4b,  e104x4-f2b,  EB1,   EB1-PoCL,   EB1mini,   miniH2B,   miniH2F,
    miniH2x4F,  mf2280,  EC1, ECB1, ECB1-34, ECB2, EL1, ELS2, EL1DB, SI1, SI2,
    or SI4), and frame generators (EB1tg or EB1miniTg), require:

             PCI SERR# Generation    Disable(d)

    to be set in the BIOS.  Otherwise, a BSoD or MPE (Memory Parity Error) may
    occur  when  the  PIXCI(R) imaging card is opened.  For some motherboards,
    this option may not exist and is, by default, disabled.

    The PIXCI(R) PCI Express and ExpressCard frame grabbers require:

             ASSERT NMI on SERR      Disable(d)

    Otherwise, a BSoD or MPE may occur  when  the  PIXCI(R)  imaging  card  is
    opened.   On some motherboards, this option is a jumper rather than a BIOS
    setting.


    4.D  Bus Mastering: Insufficient Bandwidth

    A bus mastering (DMA) type  of  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber  transfers  video
    across  the  PCI/PCIe  bus;  high  resolution, high bit depth, and/or high
    frame rate all contribute to increased use of PCI/PCIe bus bandwidth.

    The PCI/PCIe bus bandwidth of a given computer motherboard is  not  depen-
    dent  on  the  speed of the CPU, but on the attributes of the PCI/PCIe and
    memory controller chipsets, and whether the connection between the  former
    and latter is routed through other chipsets (bridges) and bottlenecks.

    Often  the  problem  is resolved by updating the motherboard BIOS, mother-
    board firmware, and graphic display driver (even on relatively new comput-
    ers), along with disabling power conservation.


    4.D.1  PCI

    For  PCI  (not  PCIe), each group of PCI slots - by design - shares memory
    bandwidth.  The PCI bus bandwidth available for video capture  depends  on
    what  other  devices are utilizing PCI bandwidth.  PCI versions of graphic
    display (S/VGA) cards and PCI based disk controllers all consume PCI band-
    width.   The  on-board  (i.e.  built onto the motherboard) graphic display
    (S/VGA) feature or disk controllers may also be internally attached to the
    PCI bus and consume PCI bandwidth.

    Using  an  AGP or PCI Express type graphic display (S/VGA) card, or an PCI
    Express disk controller, may help alleviate PCI bus bandwidth limitations.

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    4.D.2  PCIe & Motherboard Selection

    Unlike PCI, the PCIe design can provide  full  bandwidth  from  each  PCIe
    slot.  However, how the motherboard routes PCIe data may introduce bottle-
    necks and reduce bandwidth.

    Typically, Intel and other major  brand  motherboards  provide  full  PCIe
    bandwidth  and  their  `high-end' motherboards.  Lesser motherboards often
    cut corners, perhaps expecting that the average  desktop  PC  user  rarely
    plugs anything into the PCIe bus.

    For  Intel motherboards, circa 2022, avoid lower tier `H' and `B' chipsets
    which route PCIe data through the southbridge along with other data.   The
    `Z' chipsets connect the PCIe slots directly to the MCH (memory controller
    hub).


    4.D.3  Windows Configuration

    With some Intel S/VGA drivers circa 2010, use of Windows' `Aero' mode  may
    cause  the  `PCI  FIFO  Overflow' error message.  Disable the Windows Aero
    mode.


    4.D.4  Power Conservation & BIOS Configuration

    Circa 2010 and later motherboards may implement aggressive power conserva-
    tion,  reducing the available bandwidth on the PCI/PCIe bus for video rate
    data transfer.

    In BIOS, disable the:

             CPU C-State

    option.  On some HP systems, the option is instead:

             Idle Power Savings

    and should be set to `Normal' rather than `Extended'.  Other common termi-
    nology  &  features  in BIOS related to power conservation that can impact
    PCI/PCIe bandwidth are:

             C3/C6/C7/EIST
             C3/C6 State Support
             CPU Power Management
             CPU Dynamic Voltage Management
             CPU Enhanced Halt (C1E)
             Renderer Standby (RC6)

    and should be disabled.

    Other common options & features in BIOS that might impact  PCI/PCIe  band-
    width are:



                               PCI/PCIe Bus Master (DMA) & Bus Bandwidth   4-3

             Turbo Mode
             Turbo Boost
             Wifi Network

    and should, experimentally, be disabled.

    Some  systems  may not have a suitable BIOS option, or the BIOS option may
    be ignored.

    If using Linux, disabling all of ACPI (Advanced  Configuration  and  Power
    Interface)  as  a  boot time option should disable the C-State option (add
    `acpi=off' to the kernel boot command line).  Or,  disabling  PCIe's  ASPM
    (Active State Power Management) as a boot time option (add `pcie_aspm=off'
    to the kernel boot command line).  Other possible Linux boot options are:

             processor.max_cstate=1
             intel_idle.max_cstate=0

    Some laptop computers may enable C-State when  using  battery  power,  and
    disable C-State when using external power.

    In Windows 7, selecting:

             Power Plans: High Performance

    should  disable  C-State; however tests with Windows 7 and various mother-
    boards show inconsistent results.


    4.D.5  Computer Configuration

    Aside from trying  a  different  motherboard:  a) Use  PCI  Express  style
    graphic  display  (S/VGA)  card instead of a PCI or on-board style graphic
    display (S/VGA) card, b) Set the graphic display (S/VGA) to lower  resolu-
    tion, c) Upgrade the motherboard's microcode - especially for motherboards
    or computers purchased soon after release of a new design,  d) Reduce  the
    size  of  the  image  display window during live capture, and/or e) Select
    half video rate capture and display, the so-called Alternate Snap  &  Dis-
    play  mode  (in  XCAP: View, Display, Live Mode) so that video capture and
    image display alternates.









    4.E  PC Halts or Reboots




    4-4






    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    Generally: If the PC halts or reboots after the PIXCI(R) frame grabber has
    been  opened  but is not yet capturing video, the problem may be an IRQ or
    other resource conflict; see IRQ Sharing, above.  For PCI Express PIXCI(R)
    frame grabbers, also see Windows - Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), above.

    If  the  PC  halts  or  reboots  only  after a bus mastering (DMA) type of
    PIXCI(R) frame grabber is capturing video, the problem may be insufficient
    bandwidth  on  the PCI/PCIe bus.  See Bus Mastering, above, and check that
    burst mode is enabled.  See Bus Mastering: Insufficient Bandwidth,  above.
    Also, in XCAP, use:

             PIXCI
             PIXCI Video Setup

    and  reduce  the  horizontal  resolution  (i.e.  data  pixels per line) to
    (approximately) 1/4 or 1/10 of the previous value.  If video can  be  suc-
    cessfully  captured (ignoring the truncated appearance), then PCI/PCIe bus
    bandwidth was likely insufficient.


    4.F  Asus/VIA P4X266A

    Asus motherboards and VIA PCI chipsets, such as P4X266A (circa June  2002)
    do  not  implement  DMA transfers properly.  An unofficial patch by George
    Bresse (see www.tech-report.com/onearticle.x/3280) improves performance of
    these chipsets but does not entirely fix the problem.


    4.G  x4 & x8 PCI Express Slots

    On  some  motherboards  (circa  2009),  the  x4  or x8 PCI Express Slot is
    intended only for a S/VGA card - providing high bandwidth  transfers  from
    PC  memory  to  the  PCI  Express  card, but only supporting low bandwidth
    transfers from the PCI Express card into PC memory.  The  latter  mode  is
    required by PIXCI(R) frame grabbers.

    XCAP  may,  or  may not, be able to explicitly warn the user if a PIXCI(R)
    E4,  E4DB,  E4G2-2F,  E4G2-4B,  E4G2-F2B,  E8,  E8CAM,  E8DB,   e104x4-2f,
    e104x4-4b, e104x4-f2b, or SI4 is used in such a slot, depending on how the
    motherboard implements the bandwidth reduction.


    4.H  x1 & x4 PCI Express Slots

    On some motherboards with x4 PCI Express slots, BIOS provides  options  as
    to  whether  the slot is configured as a single x4 PCI Express slot, or as
    four x1 PCI Express slots (using an adapter to `break-out'  the  necessary
    signals  to  four x1 PCI Express cards.  A x4 PCI Express card can be used
    with the slot configured to the four x1 PCI Express  slot  mode,  but  the
    slot  will  not  provide  the bandwidth expected of a x4 PCI Express slot.

    The camera appears to operate correctly, the measured video frame rate and

    frame buffer retains its previous pixel data  (typically  black);  a  test
    pattern  drawn by XCAP (use XCAP's Modify, Patterns) is displayed properly
    and not overwritten by pixel data.   There  may  be  errors  reported  via
    Linux' `dmesg' related to `DMA' or `IOMMU'.

    Some Linux systems, using AMD processors, require

             iommu=soft

    to  be added to the kernel boot command line for PCI or PCIe Bus Mastering
    (DMA) to function correctly.  (Circa 09-Sep-2022).

    on Window's settings and operation of the graphics display (S/VGA) card.

    A `High Color (16 bit or 65536 Color)', `True Color (24  bit  or  16777216
    Color)',  or `True Color (32 bit)' setting for the graphic display (S/VGA)
    adapter is required for proper display of images and overlay graphics; the
    `True  Color  (24 bit or 16777216 Color)' or `True Color (32 bit)' is sug-
    gested for higher quality, and quicker,  display  of  images  and  overlay
    graphics.   in  Windows 2000, under `Control Panel', `Display', `Effects',
    the `Show window contents while dragging' should be disabled.  Or in  Win-

    There  are  reports  of  problems with later releases XCAP V2.2 using Java

                               6.  Memory Resources






    6.A  Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

    Under  Linux  and under Windows NT and later operating systems, a computer
    can be populated with 4 GiBytes of memory.  Under 64  bit  operating  sys-
    tems, a computer can be populated with more than 4 GiBytes of memory.  The
    Intel architecture overlaps  BIOS,  PCI  configuration  space,  and  other
    resources  onto  the high end of the 4 GiByte address space; the memory at
    the high end of the 4 GiByte address space is inaccessible to the  operat-
    ing system and can't be used as frame buffer memory.[1] Some 64 bit  moth-
    erboards provide a

             Remap memory above 4GB

    BIOS  option  so that memory which overlaps BIOS, PCI configuration space,
    and other resources is `moved' above 4 GiBytes and is not lost.

    The address space `takeaway' is of special  concern  when  using  forceful
    memory  allocation.   The  operating system is instructed to use less than
    the available memory (e.g. only the first 1 GiByte of 4 GiByte),  and  the
    PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber must be instructed to use an explicit address and
    size of frame buffer memory (e.g. starting at  the  1 GiByte  address  and
    using  2.5 GiByte).   Or under 64 bit operating systems where the PIXCI(R)
    frame grabber can be instructed to use an explicit  address  and  size  of
    frame  buffer memory and an explicit exclusion for the `takeaway' (e.g. on
    a computer with 8 GiByte of memory, starting at the 1 GiByte  address  and
    using 7 GiByte excluding the 0.5 GiByte `takeaway').

    If the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is instructed to use forceful memory alloca-
    tion with frame buffer memory overlapping `takeaway' address  space:  dis-
    playing  frame  buffers  which  overlap  may result in all white or random
    pixel values, capturing frame buffers  which  overlap  may  result  in  no
    effect on the contents of the frame buffer, or may severely degrade opera-
    tion of the computer system.

    BIOS typically reports how much physical memory is installed, and how much
    is  available  after `takeaways'.  Note that motherboards with PCI Express

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    support tend to have much larger `takeaways' than older motherboards  with
    32  or  64  bit PCI support.  The XCAP, Driver Assistant, Set Frame Buffer
    Memory Size feature can't  automatically  determine  the  `takeaway',  but
    takes an educated guess and sets:

             BIOS Reserved Memory Hole Size

    appropriately.   The  user  should  review the default `takeaway' size and
    correct as needed.

    The Intel Dynamic Video Memory Technology (DVMT) (circa  2006)  may  cause
    similar  problems  when  using  forceful  memory  allocation, as it uses 8
    MiByte or more allocated by BIOS at the high end of physical memory.  When
    the  computer  has less than 4 GiByte of memory and this `takeaway' occurs
    at, for example, immediately below the  2  GiByte  address,  the  PIXCI(R)
    frame  grabber  must  be instructed to use an explicit address and size of
    frame buffer memory (e.g. starting at  the  1  GiByte  address  and  using
    1016 Mbyte) so as to exclude the memory used by DVMT.

    The  Intel  vPro Technology (circa 2010?)  may cause similar problems when
    using forceful memory allocation, as it uses memory between the 768 MiByte
    and  1024 MiByte addresses.  The PIXCI(R) frame grabber must be instructed
    to use an explicit address and size of frame buffer memory (e.g.  starting
    not  lower  than the 1024 MiByte address) so as to exclude the memory used
    by vPro.


    6.B  Frame Buffer Memory vs. S/VGA Memory Space

    When trying to configure a computer for the maximum amount of frame buffer
    memory  and  the  maximum amount of frame buffers, using a S/VGA card with
    the minimal amount of S/VGA memory is often beneficial.  The S/VGA  memory
    is  mapped into the computer's memory space, reducing the amount of acces-
    sible computer memory (even if not reducing the amount  of  physical  com-
    puter  memory),  and thereby reducing the amount of available frame buffer
    memory.  (Added 19-Jan-2012).


    6.C  Using a 32 bit Frame Grabber or 32 bit Application on 64 bit O.S.

    A 32 bit frame grabber, such as the PIXCI(R) D2X, CL1, or SV5 can't access
    frame  buffer memory above the 4 GiB address.  Use on a 64 bit system with
    more than 4 GiB of memory might fail, depending on the location of  memory
    provided  by  the  O.S., showing the `Unable to access 64 bit frame buffer
    memory w. 32 bit frame grabber' error.

    A 32 bit application, using 32 bit XCLIB, has a similar restriction.   Use
    on a 64 bit system with more than 4 GiB of memory might fail, depending on
    the location of memory provided by the O.S.,  showing  the  `Frame  buffer
    memory  extends  above the 4 GiB address limit with 32 bit XCLIB on 64 bit
    O.S.'  error.

    Set the `Restrict Non-Forceful Memory to be below 4 GiByte' (in  PIXCI(R),
    PIXCI(R) Open/Close, Advanced) option followed by reboot.

    Alternately,  on Windows systems without XCAP: Use `regedit', and navigate
    into:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

    Edit the `PIXCI' key; if it doesn't exist, create it with  `String'  type.
    If the `PIXCI' key's value doesn't have a `-WT' flag, append a space and:

    to  the key's value; alternately, modify the numeric value following `-WT'
    so as to set the `0x80' (base 16) bit.  Reboot.

    7.A  Linux: Running XCAP as 'root'

    Generally, XCAP need not be run as `root' or with `super-user' status.

    The Driver Assistant in XCAP provides a convenient GUI  for  configuration
    tasks such as installing drivers, or configuring frame buffer memory.  But
    use of the Driver Assistant feature requires that XCAP be run  as  `root',
    or  with `super-user' status.  On most Linux distributions, this is easily
    done by opening a `terminal', using `sudo' to  obtain  super-user  status,
    and then running XCAP from the `terminal'.

    On openSUSE, Java based GUI programs (such as XCAP) can't be run via `ter-
    minal' and `sudo'.  The error may state `Unsatisfied Link Error' and  ref-
    erence `awt_FreeDrawingSurface'.  This problem is not specific to XCAP.

    Advice from the Linux community is to use `xdg-su', `kdesu', or `gnomesu'.
    Or use `su -' instead of `sudo'.  (Circa Jan-2018)

    Some systems may prevent any GUI programs from running  via  the  terminal
    with  super-user  status.  Typical error is `No Protocol Specified'.  This
    problem is not specific to XCAP.

    Advice from the Linux community is to use:

             export DISPLAY=:0

    or

             export DISPLAY=:0.0
             export XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority

    before running the GUI program, such as XCAP.

    Other advice suggests executing:

             xhost:localhost:root

    before using `sudo' and running the GUI program.  (Circa Apr-2017)

    Some systems will run the GUI program, but restrict its access to external
    utility programs.

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    Newer  releases of XCAP, in conjunction with many Linux distributions sup-
    porting the `gnome terminal' or `xterm', allow using XCAP's Driver  Assis-
    tant  without  running  XCAP  as super-user.  XCAP's Driver Assistant will
    instead, as needed, prepare a shell script, open a `terminal' window,  use
    `sudo'  to  prompt  the user for the appropriate password, and have `sudo'
    execute the shell script.  On  some  systems  `gnome  terminal'  can't  be
    started from XCAP; installing `xterm' is recommended, such as via:

             apt-get install xterm

    (on systems using `apt-get').  (Circa Jan-2021)


    7.B  Linux SUSE Error: 'xcb_xlib_unlock: Assertion c->xlib.lock failed'

    On distributions of openSUSE 10.x an error:

             xcb_xlib_unlock: Assertion 'c->xlib.lock' failed

    may  occur  (reported  on stderr) when running a Java application, such as
    XCAP.  This problem is not specific to XCAP.

    Workaround:

             export LIBXCB_ALLOW_SLOPPY_LOCK=1

    before running the GUI program, such as XCAP.  The workaround can be added
    to   the  /usr/local/bin/xcap  or  to  the  /usr/local/xcap/xcaplnx  shell
    scripts.  (Circa 2007)


    7.C  Linux Error: 'Cannot restore segment prot after reloc'

    Selected releases of Linux have enabled  new  security  extensions  called
    `SELinux'.   The SELinux may prevent loading of XCAP's libjpxiplhl_i386.so
    file, and perhaps other shared objects.  These problems are  not  specific
    to XCAP.

    Disable SELinux by editing /etc/selinux/config and setting

             SELINUX=disabled

    Or prevent SELinux from loading by using the

             chcon

    command on each file to which SELinux objects.  (Circa 2007)

    7.D  Linux Error: 'Cannot execute .bin file(s)'

    Attempt to execute a .bin file, such as a self contained software install-
    er, may result in a `file can't be found' error.

    Some versions of the .bin files expected the `Linux Standard  Base  (lsb)'
    libraries  which may not be automatically installed with all Linux distri-
    butions.

    Install the `Linux Standard Base (lsb)' libraries with a command such as:

             apt-get install lsb-base

    although the specific command may differ on various Linux distributions.

    Alternately, using:

             readelf -a software.bin | grep interpreter:

    should yield something similar to:

             /lib/ld-lsb.so.3              (for 32 bit pgms)
         or  /lib64/ld-lsb-x86-64.so.3     (for 64 bit pgms)

    (which, parenthetically, is the loader file that `can't be found').  Do:

             chdir /lib                    (for 32 bit pgms)
         or  chdir /lib64                  (for 64 bit pgms)

    it should contain an existing loader such as:

             ld-linux.so.2                 (for 32 bit pgms)
         or  ld-linux-x86-64.so.2          (for 64 bit pgms)

    Create a symlink:

             ln -s {existing loader} {loader expected by software.bin}

    (Circa 2013)


    7.E  Linux Error: 'Cannot execute .bin file(s)'

    Attempt to execute a .bin file, such as a self contained software install-
    er, may result in a `command not found' error.

    This will occur when attempting to execute a program in the current direc-
    tory using its (simple) name:



             software.bin

    (Circa 2005?)


    7.F  Linux Error: 'Cannot execute .bin file(s)'

    Attempt to execute a .bin file, such as a self contained software install-
    er, may result in a `permission denied' error.

    This  often  occurs after downloading an executable program, or copying an
    executable program from CD/DVD; as the necessary file  `mode'  bits  don't
    survive up/downloads and aren't supported on CD/DVD media.

    Change the file mode:

             chmod a+x software.bin

    before executing:

             ./software.bin

    (Circa 2005?)


    7.G  Linux Error: 'Unsatisfied Link Error: libjawt.so'

    When  running  a  Java  application, such as XCAP, with Java OpenJDK-11 an
    error:

             Unsatisfied Link Error: libjawt.so

    may occur (reported on stderr).  This problem is not specific to XCAP.

    This error does not occur when using XCAP on  i386  and  x86-64  platforms
    when  using  the  JRE included with XCAP.  This error occurs more often on
    ARM platforms, for which XCAP does not include a  preferred  copy  of  the
    Java JRE.

    Workaround: Find the location of libjawt.so:

             find /usr -name libjawt.so -print

    and set:

             export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='...'

    to  the proper location before running the GUI program, such as XCAP.  The
    workaround  can  be  added  to   the   /usr/local/bin/xcap   or   to   the
    /usr/local/xcap/xcaplnx shell scripts.

             export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBJAWT

    or on most systems with typical installation of multiple Java's, using:

             LIBJAWT=$( find $( readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed -e s:/bin/.*:: ) -name libjawt.so | sed -e s:/libjawt.so:: )
             export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBJAWT

    will  automate  the  process.   On newer releases of XCAP, these lines are
    provided in /usr/local/xcap/xcaplnx, as comments.  (Circa 2018)

    Newer releases of XCAP implement a  workaround  for  this  issue;  editing
    /usr/local/xcap/xcaplnx is not required.  (Circa July 2021).

    7.J  Windows Error: 'Data Execution Protection (DEP)'

    The Data Execution Protection (DEP) feature may prevent XCAP  from  start-

    7.K  Windows 8/10/11: Running XCAP as Administrator

    Generally, XCAP need not be run as with administrator privileges.

    The Driver Assistant in XCAP provides a convenient GUI  for  configuration
    tasks  such as installing drivers, or configuring frame buffer memory.  On
    Windows 8, 10, and 11 - and possibly earlier versions of Windows depending
    on  user  access  control  settings - use of the Driver Assistant requires
    that XCAP be explicitly granted with administrator privileges  -  even  if
    the user's account has administrator privileges.

    For newer versions of XCAP V3.8 (Jan 2021 and later), XCAP's Driver Assis-
    tant will open a User Account Control (UAC) dialog, asking  the  user  for
    permissions as needed.

    Alternately,  for  older  versions of XCAP, right click on XCAP's shortcut
    and select `Run as Administrator'.  The newer versions of XCAP  can  still
    be  run  as Administrator; which may be more convenient when installing or

    7.L  Windows: Anti-Viral Software with Registry Protection

    McAfee  anti-viral software with registry protection, circa 2008, prevents
    users - even those with Administrator privileges - from editing  the  reg-
    istry.   This  is, by itself, only a minor annoyance when trying to change
    PIXCI(R) frame grabber parameters.

    However, the registry protection may also prevent  Windows  Service  Packs
    from  installing  properly  (specifically  reported  with Windows XP SP3),
    causing all kinds of mischief and problems.   For  example,  the  PIXCI(R)
    driver's  `Unable  to  Map  Image  Memory (DDK MmMapIoSpace)' error may be
    intermittently reported.  (Circa Dec-2008)


    7.M  Windows & XCAP: 'Bad module(s) signature!'

    Upon startup, XCAP may report `Bad module(s) signature!'  and exit.   Most
    often,  the  `Bad module(s) signature!'  is the result of using a combina-
    tion of files from two different XCAP releases; such as might occur if  an
    XCAP  update  is  interrupted and incomplete.  The error can also occur if
    XCAP's installed files have been modified, such as by a virus or by  anti-
    viral software.  (Circa Dec-2020)

    show the PIXCI(R) driver as disabled.  The PIXCI(R) driver can be manually
    enabled; but a moment later will be disabled.

    The TrendMicro application (a background process) disables drivers that it
    dos not recognize.  See TrendMicro's instructions for adding driver(s)  to
    its `White List' of recognized and authorized drivers.  (circa Feb-2023)



    7.O  Windows: DRIVER VERIFIER DMA VIOLATION BSoD

    On Windows 10 or 11, upon opening the PIXCI(R) frame grabber (and prior to
    attempting to capture and DMA data), Windows displays  a  Blue  Screen  of
    Death (BSoD) and `DRIVER VERIFIER DMA VIOLATION'.

    This  has  been observed when Windows Virtualization Support is enabled in
    conjunction to using Cisco Security.  Disable one or  the  other.   (circa
    Apr-2023)

                           8.  Camera & Capture Issues






    8.A  Capture Issue: Pixel Data is Black

    The camera appears to operate correctly, the measured video frame rate and
    capture frame rate are correct, no errors are  reported.   But  the  frame
    buffer retains its default, black, pixel data.

    Check whether a test pattern drawn by XCAP (using XCAP's Modify, Patterns)
    is displayed properly, and whether it is replaced by a  black  image  upon
    capture  of  video.  If so, the most likely explanation is that the camera
    is sending black pixels.  Check the camera's  gain  &  exposure  settings,
    check whether the lens aperture is closed, and whether there is a cap over
    the lens!


    8.B  Capture Issue: Pixel Data not Captured

    The camera appears to operate correctly, the measured video frame rate and
    capture  frame  rate  are  correct, no errors are reported.  But the frame
    buffer retains its default pixel data (typically black or green);  a  test
    pattern  drawn  by XCAP (using XCAP's Modify, Patterns) is displayed prop-
    erly and not replaced upon capture of video.

    See PCI/PCIe Bus Master (DMA) & Bus Bandwidth, above.


    8.C  Digital Camera Capture Issue: Pixel Data not Captured

    The camera appears to operate correctly, the measured video frame rate and
    capture  frame  rate  are  correct, no errors are reported.  But the frame
    buffer retains its default pixel data (typically black or green);  a  test
    pattern  drawn  by XCAP (using XCAP's Modify, Patterns) is displayed prop-
    erly and not replaced upon capture of video.

    Many digital cameras allow setting an Area of Interest  (AOI),  so  as  to
    output  a  sub-area  of the full image.  Independently, the PIXCI(R) frame
    grabber has options to allow capturing a sub-area of the image  output  by
    the camera - regardless of whether then camera supports AOI.

    When  using  a  camera  AOI,  the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's pixel width and
    height should be set to the camera AOI's width and  height;  the  PIXCI(R)
    frame  grabber's  H-Offset and V-Offset should typically be zero - and NOT
    the same as the camera AOI's left and top offset.   If  both  offsets  are
    set, all of the image data may be skipped.



                                                 Camera & Capture Issues   8-1






    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    For  example,  a  1280x1024 camera might be set to capture the lower right
    corner: width=320, height=256, left-offset=960, top-offset=768 and  output
    an  image  of  320x256.   If the frame grabber's H-Offset and V-Offset are
    also set to 960 and 768, respectively, it would skip the first 960  pixels
    of  each  line and skip the first 768 lines output by the camera.  Between
    camera and frame grabber settings, all of the image data is skipped.


    8.D  Camera Link Capture Issue: Pixel Data not Captured

    The camera appears to operate correctly, the measured video frame rate and
    capture  frame  rate  are  correct, no errors are reported.  But the frame
    buffer retains its default pixel data (typically black or green);  a  test
    pattern  drawn  by XCAP (using XCAP's Modify, Patterns) is displayed prop-
    erly and not replaced upon capture of video.

    Selecting the `Use DVAL' option in XCAP (Generic Camera  Link,  Capture  &
    Adjust  dialog)  in  conjunction  with  a  camera that does not assert the
    optional DVAL signal prevents any pixel  data  from  being  captured.   No
    error is reported, as the imaging card, camera, and software are operating
    correctly as per the selected configuration of DVAL.  (Circa Jan-2017).


    8.E  Camera Link Capture Issue: Measured Frame Rate Incorrect and/or Pixel
         Data Garbled



    8.E.1  Medium/Full/Deca Modes

    The two cables for Medium, Full or Deca Camera Link  modes  use  different
    signal  &  wire  assignments;  control signals in one are data bits in the
    other.  Interchanging cables will often yield an extremely high and  fluc-
    tuating  frame  rate,  or a zero frame rate, Serial communication will not
    work, and will often report `Framing Error'.

    Check that the Base connector of the camera is connected to the Base  con-
    nector of the PIXCI(R) frame grabber.


    8.E.2  Poor Quality Cables

    Use  of  cables  that  do  not  meet the Camera Link specification, or are
    longer than allowed by the specification for the camera's clock  rate,  or
    have been spliced in a such a manner that the assembly no longer meets the
    Camera Link specification, will yield incorrect frame  rates  and  garbled
    pixel  data.   Serial communication will typically work, as the specifica-
    tion for the signals & wires used for  serial  communication  are  not  as
    stringent as for pixel data.

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    8.F  Capture Error: 'Video not captured! (PCI FIFO Overflow)'

    A  bus  mastering  (DMA)  type  of  PIXCI(R) frame grabber transfers video
    across the PCI/PCIe bus; high resolution,  high  bit  depth,  and/or  high
    frame  rate all contribute to increased use of PCI/PCIe bus bandwidth.  If
    sufficient PCI/PCIe bus bandwidth is not available  during  capture,  XCAP
    software reports a `PCI FIFO Overflow' error message.

    The  PCI/PCIe  bus bandwidth of a given computer motherboard is not depen-
    dent on the speed of the CPU, but on the attributes of  the  PCI/PCIe  and
    memory controller chipsets.

    See  PCI/PCIe  Bus Master (DMA) & Bus Bandwidth, and specifically Bus Mas-
    tering: Insufficient Bandwidth, above, for suggestions  regarding  mother-
    board selection and configuration.


    8.F.1  Frame Grabber Configuration

    The  PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5, SV5A, SV5B, and SV5L frame grabbers are,
    by default, configured for capturing color pixels.   For  monochrome  cam-
    eras, using:

             PIXCI
             PIXCI Open/Close
             Camera & Format

    to specify RS-170 format (or CCIR where appropriate) will reduce the band-
    width requirements (and,  by  disabling  color  burst  filtering  actually
    improve image sharpness!).  Also note that in color mode the PIXCI(R) SV4,
    SV5, SV5A, SV5B, and SV5L frame grabbers transfer 3 bytes per pixel (RGB);
    they  can  be reconfigured to transfer 2 bytes per pixel (UYVY) decreasing
    PCI bandwidth requirements, albeit at the expense of increasing CPU  over-
    head when the image is rendered or saved.

    For  PIXCI(R) A110, A310, CL2, D3XE, E1, E1DB, E4, E4DB, E4G2-2F, E4G2-4B,
    E4G2-F2B, E4TX2-2F,  E4TX2-4B,  E4TX2-F2B,  E8,  E8CAM,  E8DB,  e104x4-2f,
    e104x4-4b,   e104x4-f2b,   EB1,   EB1-PoCL,   EB1mini,  miniH2B,  miniH2F,
    miniH2x4F, mf2280, EC1, ECB1, ECB1-34, ECB2, EL1, EL1DB, ELS2,  SI1,  SI2,
    SI4,  SV7,  and SV8 frame grabbers can, depending on camera, be configured
    to capture 8 or more bits per pixel value.  In 10 or 12 bit mode the frame
    grabber  can  use  two  bytes per value; or `pack' four 10 bit values into
    five bytes or two 12 bit values into three bytes.  Use of the  `Bit  Pack-
    ing' option will reduce PCIe bandwidth requirements by 3/8 for 10 bit val-
    ues or by 1/4 for 12 bit values, albeit at the expense of  increasing  CPU
    overhead  when  the  image  is  rendered or saved.  The PIXCI(R) EB1tg and
    EB1miniTg frame generators also provide a `Bit Packing'  option,  reducing
    PCIe bandwidth when generating 10 or 12 bit pixel values.








                                                 Camera & Capture Issues   8-3






    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    8.F.2  Camera Cabling

    For  systems  using  Camera Link or Parallel LVDS, the `PCI FIFO Overflow'
    can be caused by excessive cable length (relative to  the  camera's  pixel
    clock  frequency),  poor  quality  cables, or cable connectors not tightly
    fastened in place, causing degradation of the  camera's  pixel  clock  and
    data to be `clocked in' at a higher rate than intended.


    8.G  Capture Issue: Measured Frame Rate is Zero

    The measured video frame rate is zero, no errors are reported.


    8.G.1  Camera

    For  PIXCI(R)  SV2,  SV3, SV4, SV5, SV7, and SV8 frame grabbers, the video
    rate will be non-zero with, or without a camera attached.  But  for  other
    frame  grabbers, if the camera is not attached, the camera not powered on,
    or the camera in trigger mode w/out being triggered,  the  measured  frame
    rate will be zero.


    8.G.2  Interrupts (IRQ)

    Measurement  of the video rate, as does video capture, depends upon inter-
    rupts (IRQ).  See PCI/PCIe Interrupts (IRQ), above.

    As an interim solution, polling can be used instead  of  interrupts.   See
    XCAP's  PIXCI(R),  PIXCI(R) Open/Close, Close, Advanced, Interrupts.  How-
    ever, polling is less efficient and is primarily intended to help diagnose
    interrupt issues.


    8.H  Camera Link Issue: Serial Communication Failure

    Serial communication depends upon interrupts (IRQ).

    See PCI/PCIe Interrupts (IRQ), above.

    Check  that  the baud rate selection matches the camera's baud rate.  Some
    cameras have selectable baud rate and its current baud rate may not  match
    the  default  rate specified in camera documentation; experiment with dif-
    ferent baud rate selections.

    As an interim solution, for cameras using slower baud rates,  polling  can
    be  used instead of interrupts.  See XCAP's PIXCI(R), PIXCI(R) Open/Close,
    Close, Advanced, Interrupts.  However, polling is less  efficient  and  is
    primarily intended to help diagnose interrupt issues.

                             9.  Miscellaneous Topics






    9.A  XCAP Startup Issues

    By default, XCAP automatically opens the PIXCI(R) frame grabber, automati-
    cally displays an image,  and  automatically  (optionally)  captures  live
    video.  To help determine the cause of a startup problem, such as software
    hangup or abort, it is helpful to separate these actions.

    Edit file:

             xcap.ini

    in XCAP's installation directory.  Change line:

             videosetup.xc.autoopen=1

    to:

             videosetup.xc.autoopen=0

    and change line:

             videosetup.xc.autolive=1

    to:

             videosetup.xc.autolive=0

    Start XCAP to see if it crashes w/out having tried to display an image  or
    open the PIXCI(R) frame grabber.

    In XCAP, do:

             Images
             New Image
             OK
             Modify (in Image View Window)
             Patterns
             OK

    If  XCAP  crashes,  it  is  likely  a problem with the API used to display
    images.  Restart XCAP and try:

    to explicitly start live capture.


    9.B  XCAP/XCLIB Error: 'Can't access 18V8/16LV8'

    The `Can't access 18V8/16LV8' error normally indicates a hardware  problem
    on  a  PIXCI(R)  SV2,  SV3,  SV4, SV5, SV5A, SV5B, SV5L, or SV6.  The same
    error can also occur if the PIXCI(R) driver has  been  associated  with  a
    non-PIXCI card; see PCI Vendor and Device ID Conflict, above.

    The  same  error may also occur under Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10, or 11 after
    awaking from hibernation or sleep mode.  Disabling Sleep  and  Hibernation
    modes  in  Windows  is  recommended.   An  updated  driver,  circa 6/2015,
    (a) Will prevent Windows from sleeping while the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is
    in  use,  and (b) Has an option to enable recovery after Windows sleeps w.
    the PIXCI(R) frame grabber not in use.

    Under Windows 10 or 11, the same  error  may  occur  with  Windows'  `Fast
    Startup'  option  enabled;  disabling  the  option is recommended.  (Circa
    2009, 2015, 2022)









    9.C  XCAP/XCLIB Error: 'Data path error'




    9-2






    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    The `Data path error' error normally indicates a  hardware  problem  on  a
    PIXCI(R) A110, A310, D3XE, CL1, CL2, E1, E1DB, E4, E4DB, E4G2-2F, E4G2-4B,
    E4G2-F2B, E4TX2-2F,  E4TX2-4B,  E4TX2-F2B,  E8,  E8CAM,  E8DB,  e104x4-2f,
    e104x4-4b,   e104x4-f2b,   EB1,   EB1-PoCL,   EB1mini,  miniH2B,  miniH2F,
    miniH2x4F, mf2280, EC1, ECB1, ECB1-34, ECB2, EL1, EL1DB, ELS2,  SI1,  SI2,
    SI4,  SV7, or SV8 frame grabber, or on a PIXCI(R) EB1tg or EB1miniTg frame
    generator.

    The same error will also occur under Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10, or 11  after
    awaking  from  hibernation or sleep mode.  Disabling Sleep and Hibernation
    modes in  Windows  is  recommended.   An  updated  driver,  circa  6/2015,
    (a) Will prevent Windows from sleeping while the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is
    in use, and (b) Has an option to enable recovery after Windows  sleeps  w.
    the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber  not in use.  Less often, the hibernation or
    sleep problem may be reported as `Invalid register base address', with the
    same remedy.

    On  Windows  10  or  11,  the same error can occur with the Windows' `Fast
    Startup' option enabled; disabling  the  option  is  recommended.   (Circa
    2009, 2015)

    On  Windows  10  or  11, the same error can occur with the Windows' `Power
    Button does ...'  option set to `Hibernate' or `Sleep'; use of  `Shutdown'
    is recommended.  (circa 2018)

    The  same  error can occur due to EMI interference with the PCIe signals -
    especially when the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is used with a bus extender  or
    bus extension cable.  (circa 2022)

    Generally, the error will persist until the computer is restarted.


    9.D  XCAP/XCLIB Error: 'Drivers Not Installed' or 'Frame Grabber not
         Found'

    Under Windows (XP & later) and under Linux, a bus manager or bus driver is
    responsible for configuring the PCI Express slot, detecting  the  PIXCI(R)
    frame  grabber,  and  (indirectly) loading the appropriate PIXCI(R) driver
    (or setting conditions so that the driver remains loaded).

    After an application reports that the PIXCI(R) driver isn't available,  it
    is  often helpful to distinguish whether the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is not
    present, or whether the frame grabber is present but the driver  is  miss-
    ing.

    Under Linux, the

             lspci

    command  lists  all  detected  PCI  and  PCI Express cards - regardless of
    whether a card-specific driver is installed.





                                                    Miscellaneous Topics   9-3






    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    Under Windows, the Device Manager (i.e.  `devmgmt.msc') lists all detected
    PCI  and  PCI Express cards - regardless of whether a card-specific driver
    is installed.  Although, without an installed driver  the  PIXCI(R)  frame
    grabber  may not be listed by name under `Imaging Devices', but may appear
    as an unnamed card under the `Unknown' or `Coprocessor'  sections;  deter-
    mine  whether the unnamed card is a PIXCI(R) frame grabber via: (a) Power-
    off computer, remove card, reboot, observe whether the Device Manager list
    has  changed,  or  (b) In  the  Device Manager, under a suspected device's
    `Properties', `Details' select and  compare  the  `Hardware  IDs'  to  the
    PIXCI(R) frame grabber's Vendor and Device ID as listed under Required Bus
    Resources, above.

    If the PIXCI(R) frame grabber does not appear via `lspci'  or  the  Device
    Manager,  then  tweaking  PIXCI(R) driver options or trying different ver-
    sions of the PIXCI(R) driver won't help.

    Suggested remedies are to check that the card is firmly seated in the  PCI
    or  PCIe  slot,  check  BIOS for options which may enable/disable PCI/PCIe
    slots, and/or consult the motherboard documentation.

    The PIXCI(R) miniH2B, miniH2F, and miniH2x4F frame grabbers are  not  pow-
    ered  from the motherboard, but require a separate +12V power supply.  For
    those cards, also check that the +12V is connected and powered on  at  the
    same time as the computer.


    9.E  Use of M.2 Interface Adapters

    PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's designed for PCIe mini slots can use a M.2 slot
    via a third party adapter.  M.2 slots can support either the PCIe or  SATA
    interface, as selected by pin 69 (grounded for SATA, or N/C for PCIe).  If
    the PIXCI(R) frame grabber isn't found by the O.S.  (i.e.  doesn't  appear
    in  Device  Manager  or  `lspci'), check the specifications of the adapter
    and/or check whether the adapter's pin 69 is grounded.  (Circa 2019)


    9.F  Mice and Graphics Display (S/VGA) Cards

    If the mouse cursor blinks on and off while the mouse cursor is positioned
    over the live video image display, either:

      a.  Switch  to  a  graphics  display (S/VGA) card that provides hardware
          mouse cursor support.

      b.  If the graphics display (S/VGA) card does  provides  hardware  mouse
          cursor  support,  contact  the graphics display (S/VGA) manufacturer
          for an improved driver.

      c.  As a last resort, in XCAP, switch graphics display  (S/VGA)  display
          modes  from the faster, default `DirectX API' to a (possibly slower)
          alternative:

                             10.  Authorization Keys






    10.A  Parallel Port Style Keys

    Selected versions of EPIX(R) imaging software are provided with an  autho-
    rization  key which must be connected to printer parallel port 1, 2, or 3.
    Should software advise that the authorization key is not found:

      a.  Check that the key is connected to printer parallel port 1, 2, or 3,
          and   not   to  an  RS-232  or  other  port  using  the  same  style
          connector,[2]

      b.  For PC's with plug in parallel port adapters which are  not  Plug  &
          Play:  Check that multiple parallel port adapters with the same port
          number are not installed or enabled,[3]

      c.  For PC's using DOS, or Windows 95/98 with a dual boot option to DOS:
          After  running  the  MSD  program,  use `L' to check whether any LPT
          ports are configured,

      d.  Check that the BIOS setting, if any, for  the  printer  port  allows
          PC-AT compatibility.  A typical BIOS Setup entry is:

                   Parallel Port Type      Compatible

          Settings such as:

                   Parallel Port Type      EPP
                   Parallel Port Type      ECP

          may  prevent  recognition  of  the  key,  or  may  prevent  reliable


    __________

     2. Connection to a 25-pin serial (RS-232) port, or to any other interface
        which happens to use the same style connector, may permanently damage
        the authorization key and void its warranty.

     3. Multiple parallel port adapters set at the same port number may have
        no adverse impact on printer operation; but an authorization key
        attached to these ports will not operate correctly.  Even though the
        printer works, the parallel port adapter configuration must still be
        checked.

          printing.

      e.  On rare combinations of PC's and printers, the authorization key may
          not  be  recognized  if  the  printer  (connected to the back of the
          authorization key) is powered off;  either  disconnect  the  printer
          cable or turn the printer on.

      f.  On  certain  PC's,  the printer port and therefore the authorization
          key may be improperly reset  during  boot.   Under  DOS  or  Windows
          95/98, add:

                   HLRESET.COM     (precede with path name to directory of EPIX(R) software!)

          as the last line of AUTOEXEC.BAT to reset the key.

    Typically,  the authorization key can be `stacked' on the printer parallel
    port with other authorization keys for other software; however due to  the
    wide variety of key types provided by other companies, there is no guaran-
    tee of mutual compatibility.  (Circa 1996).

    Newer versions of EPIX(R) imaging software can optionally use a  USB  ver-
    sion  of the authorization for use in conjunction with an operating system
    with USB support.  Use of a USB key eliminates printer parallel port  con-
    figuration issues.


    10.B  Parallel Port Keys vs. Xilinx Keys

    The  JTAG programming tools key from Xilinx should NOT be stacked onto the
    XCAP authorization key.  (Circa 2004).


    10.C  64 Bit Linux Driver for Parallel Port Keys

    The driver to support parallel port style authorization keys may not  com-
    pile  on  newer  64  bit  kernels in which the register_ioctl32_conversion
    function has been deprecated.  Use of  the  USB  style  authorization  key
    avoids  the  problem  and is recommended for 64 bit Linux systems.  (Circa
    2005).


    10.D  USB Style Blue Keys

    It may assist with some system configuration issues to know that  the  USB
    Blue  key  has Vendor ID of 0529 and a Device ID of 0001, and may be vari-
    ously identified as a Aladdin Hardlock, Aladdin  USB  Key,  Aladdin  HASP,
    Safenet HASP device, or Gemalto HASP device.

    The   smaller   version   of  the  USB  authorization  key  (approximately
    5.2x1.6x0.8 cm), has a LED visible through  the  plastic  case.   The  LED
    illuminates  after  the  key  has  been  connected and identified as a USB
    device, regardless of whether XCAP  is  running  or  the  appropriate  key
    driver(s)  are installed.  An unlit LED typically implies a bad key, a bad

    USB slot, or the operating system's USB drivers are not (yet) loaded.

    On Linux Ubuntu distributions with 2.6.31 and later kernels,  the  `usbde-
    vfs'  and  `usbfs'  Linux  features  used  by the authorization key daemon
    aksusbd as supplied with XCAP V3.0 or V3.7 are  no  longer  supported.   A
    newer  aksusbd  and  its  associated hasp.rules and dinst as supplied with
    XCAP V3.8 (Oct 2013 release) resolves  the  issue.   Those  files  can  be
    extracted  from  the V3.8 release for use with XCAP V3.0 or V3.7; however,
    the authorization key must be installed manually  via  dinst,  the  Driver
    Assistant in V3.0 or V3.7 should not be used.

    The  Linux  aksusbd authorization key daemon for USB keys is a 32 bit pro-
    gram; The Linux IA32 (32 bit compatibility) libraries must  be  installed.
    Some  64  bit distributions are not pre-configured to allow running 32 bit
    programs; use

             sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

    to allow running aksusbd.

    The aksusbd must be installed as root to work  properly,  even  though  it
    allows itself to be installed as non-root.  Check owner of:

             ls -la /tmp/.aksusb

    which reflects the (effective) user that was used to install aksusbd.


    10.E  Windows Remote Desktop & Blue Keys

    If  the first access to an authorization key is via a program (i.e. XCAP),
    initiated via a remote desktop connection then the authorization  key  may
    not be properly detected.

    One  workaround  is  to have XCAP auto-started when Windows boots; running
    XCAP from a remote desktop connection would no longer be the first  access
    to  the  authorization  key.   The  XCAP  `Auto Startup: Wait for Drivers'
    option should be enabled, as Windows might auto start XCAP before  loading
    the authorization key's driver.  (Circa 2008).


    10.F  Authorization Blue Key Not Found under Windows 2000 and later

    The  authorization  key  vendor  reports  that  some USB keys manufactured
    between 2006 and 2008 may appear to fail.   A  new  authorization  driver,
    Version 4.115.5.55 (Oct 2008), or later, fixes the problem.  (Circa 2008).

    It  may  assist with some system configuration issues to know that the USB
    Green key has Vendor ID of 07F2 and a Device ID of 0001, and may be  iden-
    tified as a Keylok II.  (Circa 2021)

    11.A  DOS4GW - Serial ATA's AHCI Mode

    Running an XCLIB DOS4GW application in conjunction with a serial ATA (i.e.
    hard drive) configured to AHCI mode  may  cause  the  computer  to  crash.
    Selecting  serial  ATA  Compatibility  mode  instead  of AHCI mode in BIOS
    appears to eliminate the problem.  (Circa Mar-2008)


    11.B  DOS4GW - (S/VGA) Settings - Colors & Grey Levels

    The XCIP program for DOS supports  graphic  display  (S/VGA)  cards  which
    include  VESA  BIOS  support.   Adapters without VESA BIOS support will be
    operated in VGA mode.  Within MSD[4], the `V' command  will  show  whether
    VESA  BIOS support is available.  For display cards lacking VESA BIOS sup-
    port, a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident program) supplied by  the  card's
    manufacturer must be loaded before XCIP is run.

    For  S/VGA modes which provide 224 colors, (the default choice of XCIP for
    DOS when used with color video), some  S/VGA  cards  require  2 MiByte  of
    S/VGA  memory, but allow switching to this mode even when only 1 MiByte of
    memory is installed.  The  symptom  is  a  VGA  screen  wraparound,  which
    appears  about 5 text lines from the top and/or bottom.  Additional memory
    should be added to the S/VGA card, a different S/VGA card  used,  or  XCIP
    advised  to  forgo  color  display by use of the `-svga 640x480x8' command
    line option.

    For application programs running under DOS or Windows 95/98, the  presence
    of  EMM386  may  prevent proper operation of bus mastering PCI cards.  The
    EMM386.SYS should be removed from CONFIG.SYS.

    11.D  Windows 95/98 - PCI Bus Master (DMA) - EMM386.SYS Issues

    For application programs running under DOS or Windows 95/98, the  presence
    of  EMM386  may  prevent proper operation of bus mastering PCI cards.  The
    EMM386.SYS should be removed from CONFIG.SYS.  (Circa 1995)


    11.E  Windows 95/98 - DOS Box & Bus Mastering

    DOS versions of EPIX(R) imaging software will not work with PCI  bus  mas-
    tering  cards  when  run under a DOS prompt under Windows.  Either boot to
    real DOS, or under Windows 95/98 use `Start', `Shut  Down',  and  `Restart
    the Computer in MS-DOS Mode'.  (Circa 1995)


    11.F  Windows 95/98 - IRQ Sharing

    Under  Windows 95 and 98, on some motherboards, the Windows Device Manager
    may be able to change the assigned IRQ.  In  the  Control  Panel,  System,
    Device  Manager, click `Computer', `Properties', `Interrupt Request (IRQ)'
    to display a list of devices and their IRQ's.  Find the device  using  the
    same  IRQ as the PIXCI(R) frame grabber.  In the Device Manager, highlight
    the offending card and  click  `Properties',  `Resources'.   Uncheck  `Use
    automatic settings', highlight the IRQ, click `Change Setting', and select
    a different IRQ.


    11.G  Windows 95/98 - Drivers - Registry Issues

    Under Windows 95 and 98, automatic recognition  and  installation  of  PCI
    cards  is  dependent  upon each PCI card's unique ID, and gets confused if
    there are two or more different cards with the same ID,  even  if  one  of
    them  is no longer installed.  For example, the PIXCI(R) SV2 and SV3 frame
    grabber ID's are determined by a Philips PCI Bus Interface chip, and  thus
    share  the  same  ID  as  other cards using the same chip.  Similarly, the
    PIXCI(R) SV4, SV5, SV5A, SV5B, SV5L, and SV6 frame grabber  ID  is  deter-
    mined  by a Brooktree (Conexant) PCI Bus Interface chip.  Before automatic
    installation of the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's drivers can succeed, the Win-
    dows  95  and 98 registry entries and .INF files for all impostors must be
    removed:

          For  safety,  move these to a new subdirectory (of any name), rather
          than deleting the files.  The Driver Assistant in XCAP  can  perform
          the registry cleanup automatically, although it does not save any of
          the removed files.

      c.  Reboot the PC.  When Windows requests drivers for the PIXCI(R) frame
          grabber,  specify the directory into which XCIP or XCAP software was
          previously unpacked.

    Alternately, use the manual installation of the driver and modification of
    the registry, as per the installation instructions.


    11.H  Windows 95/98 - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

    Under  Windows  95 and 98, when using EPIXXC.SYS to allocate large amounts
    of frame buffer memory, problems may arise if other devices require memory
    within  a specific range of physical addresses.  In particular ATI graphic
    display (S/VGA) cards and some 3COM  network  interface  cards  appear  to
    require  memory  below  64 MiByte.  Memory for these needs can be reserved
    with the:

             -MH KiByte_to_reserve

    parameter to EPIXXC.SYS.  Using `-MH 1024' is sufficient  for  ATI  cards,
    using `-MH'8192 or `-MH'16384 is sufficient for the 3COM 3C900.

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    11.I  Windows 95/98 - BIOS Plug & Play - Other BIOS Issues

    Some versions of BIOS may have a setting to select the operating system:

             Operating System: Windows 95/98
                               Other

    These  systems might run under Windows NT with the wrong BIOS setting, but
    Plug & Play PCI cards may not operate correctly.


    11.J  Windows 95/98 - Graphic Display (S/VGA) Settings

    The XCIP and XCAP programs for Windows display imagery on  the  computer's
    graphic  display  (S/VGA) monitor.  The quality of the displayed images is
    dependent on Window's settings  and  operation  of  the  graphics  display
    (S/VGA)  card.   The default Windows 95 installation, for example, may use
    the 16 Color setting, resulting in poor quality image display!   For  Win-
    dows  95/98  and  Windows NT, the settings can be modified in the `Control
    Panel', `Display', `Settings'.

    For the XCIP program for Windows, a `256 Color' setting is  suggested  for
    display of monochrome images, a `True Color (24 bit or 16777216 Color)' or
    `True Color (32 bit)' setting is suggested for display of color or pseudo-
    colored images.

    For  the XCAP program for Windows, a `High Color (16 bit or 65536 Color)',
    `True Color (24 bit or 16777216 Color)', or `True Color (32 bit)'  setting
    for  the graphic display (S/VGA) adapter is required for proper display of
    images and overlay graphics; the `True Color (24 bit or  16777216  Color)'
    or  `True  Color  (32  bit)' is suggested for higher quality, and quicker,
    display of images and overlay graphics.  Also, in Windows 95, under  `Con-
    trol Panel', `Display', `Plus!', the `Show window contents while dragging'
    must be disabled (this feature is not present in older versions of Windows
    95).   Or  in Windows 98, under `Control Panel', `Display', `Effects', the
    `Show window contents while dragging' should be disabled.

    After changing the settings a full shutdown and CTRL+ALT+DEL reboot should
    be  used.  (The quick restart offered by older versions of Windows 95, and
    the dynamic graphic display (VGA) reconfiguration performed by newer  ver-
    sions of Windows 95/98, may not re-initialize all devices properly).


    11.K  Windows NT - PCI Card Resources - Resource Allocation

    Later  versions  of  Windows NT may re-allocate PCI resources allocated by
    BIOS, when it `moves the PCI device resources on top of another PCI device
    that has not yet been claimed' (see Microsoft article Q152044).  This most
    often causes a problem when multiple PIXCI(R) frame grabbers are used.  It
    may be prevented by adding the /PCILOCK option to a C:\BOOT.INI entry, for
    example:





                                                               Archives   11-5

             [operating systems]
             multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows NT V 4.00"  /PCILOCK

    Do not copy this new line exactly as is; the first  portion  of  the  line
    must  be  copied  from  an existing configuration line in your C:\BOOT.INI
    file.


    11.L  Windows NT - Serial Mice versus Cameras w. RS-232 Control

    Under Windows NT, the  auto  configuration  performed  while  booting  can
    incorrectly  identify  certain  cameras  with  RS-232 controls as a serial
    mouse.  Any COM port incorrectly identified  becomes  unavailable  to  all
    applications, such as XCAP.

    A simple solution is to leave the camera powered off or disconnected while
    booting.  Alternately, in Control Panel, Services or  Devices,  the  `ser-
    mouse'  service  can be set to manual.  Alternately, the boot.ini file can
    be edited adding:

             /NoSerialMouse              disable detection on all COM ports
             /NoSerialMouse:COMx         disable detection on COMx ports
             /NoSerialMouse:COMx,y,z     disable detection on COMx, y, and z ports

    to the end of any or all boot descriptor lines, such as:

             multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows NT ..." /NoSerialMouse

    Some versions of Windows NT may instead require the:

             /FASTDETECT

    option in boot.ini; consult your Windows systems administrator  for  addi-
    tional guidance.  (Circa 1996)
