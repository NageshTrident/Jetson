    RELEASE NOTES: XCAP  -- Version 3.0, V3.7, V3.8

      1.  Version  3.0 released.  Adds support for Windows Vista, Windows XP(x64),
          and Linux 64 Bit.  (28-Feb-2007).

      2.  Fixed Feature: Blob analysis, using Retain Regions and  not  using  Full
          Statistics  would  show  the  bounding rectangle in incorrect locations.
          (26-Mar-2007)

      3.  New Feature: The Birger EF232 Lens Mount, providing aperture  and  focus
          lens  control  in  conjunction  with  Canon EF lenses, is now supported.
          (05-Jun-2007)

      4.  Improved Feature: Sequence Capture now offers both event start and event
          stop  triggers,  for both Linear Sequence and Circular Sequence.  Previ-
          ously, event start was available only with  Linear  Sequence  and  event
          stop was available only with Circular Sequence.  (19-Jun-2007).

      5.  Fixed  Feature:  Under Windows, depending on PC speed, the Video to Disk
          will run once, correctly, but may  then  issue  a  `Invalid  Parameters'
          error  until the PIXCI(R) is closed and re-opened.  The Video to Virtual
          memory will run multiple times until that feature is closed;  thereafter
          may  issue  the  same  error until the PIXCI(R) is closed and re-opened.
          (10-Aug-2007)

      6.  Improved Feature: Sequence Capture, Video  to  Image  Files  now  allows
          specifying  .avi  format  - with the entire sequence saved into a single
          file.  (Previously supported .bmp, .tif. jpg formats saved one image per
          file.)   However,  saving all images into a single .avi precludes use of
          Circular Capture mode, precludes modifying the images after capture, and
          precludes  viewing  the  images  as captured (although live video in the
          PIXCI(R) Viewer window is still displayed).  For time lapse photography,
          using  single  file  has the disadvantage that in event of power failure
          during  capture,  the  previously   captured   images   may   be   lost.
          (18-Sep-2007)

      7.  Improved  Feature:  Sequence  Capture, Video to Image Files and Video to
          Disk has been improved so that in non-circular mode and with the  number
          of  images  captured not greater than the number of frame buffers, there
          will never be a `A captured image could not be saved - Use a faster disk
          or  a slower capture rate.'  error.  Thus, these can be used as a conve-
          nient replacement for doing Sequence Capture,  Video  to  Frame  Buffers
          followed by saving the captured images to disk.  (21-Sep-2007)

      8.  Modified  Feature: The popup helpful hints are now, by default disabled.
          Even for XCAP-Lite.  (13-Dec-2007)

      9.  Modified Feature: Under Windows NT, 2000, XP, and Vista the default XCAP
          installation  directory  has  been changed to \Program Files\EPIX\XCAP .
          When installing a newer version over an older version  in  C:\XCAP,  the












                                         - 2 -



          installer will continue to default to C:\XCAP .

             XCAP for 32 bit Windows 2000, XP, and Vista now uses a newer Java run
          time environment, which is not compatible with Windows 95,  98,  ME,  or
          NT.   The  new run time environment supports the Vista `Aero' interface,
          as well as other improvements.  There are now two  distributions:  XCAP-
          WIN32.EXE  for  Windows 2000, XP, and Vista and XCAPWIN32JRE9598MENT.EXE
          for Windows 95, 98, ME, and NT.  There is also a  XCAPWIN32NOJRE.EXE;  a
          smaller  service  pack  for updating XCAP without re-installing the Java
          run time environment.  (17-Dec-2007)

     10.  Fixed Feature: When installing to the aforementioned new default  direc-
          tory  under Vista, the installer must be explicitly run with Administra-
          tor privileges, or else a `Can't write file  (err=6)'  occurs.   Not  so
          when installing to the old default directory.  (31-Jan-2008).

     11.  Improved  Feature:  XCAP for Windows now includes the Camera Link Serial
          API DLL, which is required when using a camera  manufacturer's  software
          to  configure  a camera via serial commands.  It is not needed when XCAP
          provides its own integrated serial control GUI.  Inclusion of  the  DLL,
          rather  than  obtaining  it  separately,  makes  use of the cameras with
          XCAP's `Generic Camera Link' controls more convenient.  The Camera  Link
          Serial API DLL is installed via the `Driver Assistant'.  (11-Feb-2008)

     12.  Fixed  Feature: The `Script Tool Bar' was inadvertently disabled in XCAP
          V3.0.  Loading of .avi files larger than 4 GB was inadvertently disabled
          in XCAP V3.0.  (11-Feb-2008)

     13.  Added  Feature:  XCAP for Windows now supports Windows Vista 64-Bit with
          Service Pack 1 or later; use with Vista 64-Bit prior to SP1 is not  rec-
          ommended.  (13-Apr-2008)

     14.  Fixed/Added  Feature: 64 bit versions of XCAP now support PC based image
          sequences larger  than  4 GB,  previously  only  PIXCI(R)  frame  buffer
          sequences larger than 4 GB were supported.  (14-May-2008)

     15.  Improved Feature: The Script Player now allows starting operations, such
          as sequence capture, and continuing  execution  of  the  script  without
          awaiting completion of the operation.  (04-Jun-2008)

     16.  New  Feature:  Now  has  partial  and beta-level support for new SILICON
          VIDEO(R) 9C10 camera.  (01-Jul-2008)

     17.  Fixed Feature: On 64 bit systems, the Advanced Color  Space  Calibration
          feature  (for Bayer output cameras), the Warping with Fiducials feature,
          and the Spatial Calibration with Rotation feature  may  XCAP  to  abort.
          (20-Aug-2008)

     18.  Specifications  for  XCAP-Ltd  stated that polar reticles, that protrac-
          tors, and that line profile with any  but  a  straight  line,  were  not












                                         - 3 -



          provided;  these features were in fact allowed by XCAP-Ltd, but have now
          been disabled.  Specifications for XCAP-Ltd stated that paint  fill  was
          provided,  this  feature was in fact disallowed by XCAP-Ltd, but has now
          been enabled.  (03-Sep-2008)

     19.  New Feature: For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 5C10 and 5M10  cameras,  defective
          pixel substitution is now provided.  (15-Oct-2008)

     20.  Fixed  Feature:  With  a  PIXCI(R) D2X, CL1, or SI, with versions of the
          V3.0 driver with added support for PCI Express, using the PIXCI(R)  Dia-
          log  while  video  capture is pending or in progress may cause the video
          capture to be aborted.  (10-Mar-2009)

     21.  New Feature: XCAP now includes a /dev/tty Linux driver for the  PIXCI(R)
          frame grabbers, installable via the Driver Assistant.  The tty driver is
          not needed by XCAP, but allows third party applications  to  communicate
          with Camera Link cameras.  (21-Apr-2009)

     22.  New  Feature:  Now  has  beta-level support for new SILICON VIDEO(R) 643
          camera.  (24-Aug-2009)

     23.  Fixed Feature:  In  rare  cases,  USB  authorization  keys  manufactured
          between  2006  and  2008  may fail and not be recognized by XCAP.  A new
          authorization key driver, version 4.115.5.55 (Oct  2008),  now  included
          with   XCAP,   provides   a  remedy  without  having  to  replace  keys.
          (14-Sep-2009)

     24.  Version  3.7   released,   adding   support   for   Windows 7 32/64-Bit.
          (07-Nov-2009).

     25.  Improved Feature: The Driver Assistant now provides an option to install
          a Camera Link Serial DLL with either V1.0 or V1.1  of  the  API;  previ-
          ously,  only  V1.1  was  available  from XCAP (with V1.0 available sepa-
          rately).  Under 64 bit Windows, the Driver  Assistant  now  provides  an
          option  to  install either a 32 or 64 bit DLL version of the Camera Link
          Serial DLL, so as to  match  the  manufacturer's  application  software.
          (22-Dec-2009)

     26.  Improved Feature: Under Windows using `Aero' display, the Screen Capture
          feature no longer operates extremely slowly.  (30-Dec-2009)

     27.  New Feature: Now  has  support  for  new  PIXCI(R)  SI2  frame  grabber.
          (03-Feb-2010)

     28.  New Feature: The AGC/AEC feature for SILICON VIDEO(R) and other selected
          cameras now allows ignoring `whitish' pixels, for  better  results  when
          capturing portraits.  (22-Jun-2010)

     29.  New  Feature:  The  32  bit  version of XCAP can now open PIXCI(R) frame
          grabbers under under 64 bit Windows; previously only the 64 bit  version












                                         - 4 -



          of  XCAP could be used under 64 bit Windows.  The 32 bit version is lim-
          ited to less than than 4 GiByte of frame buffer memory.  Also, the frame
          buffer memory must be in the lower 4 MiByte of PC memory.  (11-Oct-2010)

     30.  Improved  Feature:  For PIXCI(R) frame grabbers with multiple functional
          units (e.g. EL1DB, E4DB, SI2, SI4, ...)  and under a Windows Plug & Play
          O.S.   (i.e. Windows 2000 and later) the default Multiple Devices selec-
          tion of which boards or functional units are to  be  opened  is  changed
          from  the  first board or functional unit to all functional units of the
          first physical board.  (15-Nov-2010)

     31.  New Feature: Now supports the SILICON VIDEO(R) WGA-C and WGA-M  cameras.
          (14-Dec-2010)

     32.  New  Feature: For color cameras that output Bayer format color, the Mod-
          ify features now allow selecting a Bayer color space.  This is  particu-
          larly useful for averaging corresponding pixels of a sequence of images.
          (04-Jan-2011)

     33.  New  Feature:  Now   supports   the   PIXCI(R)   SV5L   frame   grabber.
          (06-Jan-2011)

     34.  Modified  Feature:  The Zoom shortcut now activates or deactivates zoom,
          instead of popping up the  Zoom,  Pan,  Scroll  dialog.   Increasing  or
          decreasing  magnification  can  now  be done via mouse click; previously
          changes  to  magnification  could  only   be   done   in   the   dialog.
          (14-Feb-2011)

     35.  Fixed Feature: Under Windows Vista & 7, XCAP's auto-restart after enter-
          ing a software activation code would not work if XCAP  was  run  without
          administrator  privileges.   The  fix,  using a different section of the
          Windows registry, affects the TWAIN and ImagePro Sourcery driver  `auto-
          start' feature; updated drivers must be used.  (01-Mar-2011)

     36.  New  Feature:  Now  has beta-level support for new SILICON VIDEO(R) 10C6
          camera.  (08-Mar-2011)

     37.  Fixed Feature: The Video to Disk, when used with the Include Date & Time
          Stamp  option,  and  depending on camera type and resolution, may record
          the last few pixels of each image as zero.  (14-Apr-2011)

     38.  New Feature: Now has beta-level support for new PIXCI(R) E8 frame  grab-
          ber.  (19-Jul-2011)

     39.  Improved Feature: When used with multiple frame grabbers and common con-
          trols, the Video to Disk feature now allows explicitly specifying a path
          and filename for each board, rather than a single file pattern that gen-
          erates filenames for all.  This provides easier  mapping  of  a  board's
          file to a specific disk and disk controller.













                                         - 5 -



             Similarly,  when  used  with  multiple frame grabbers and common con-
          trols, the Video to Image Files feature now allows explicitly specifying
          a  file  pattern  for each board, instead of a single file pattern which
          generates multiple files names for all boards.  (10-Aug-2011)

     40.  New Feature: Now has  support  for  new  PIXCI(R)  A310  frame  grabber.
          (08-Sep-2011)

     41.  Improved  Feature:  The  Video  to  Disk  feature now records all of the
          active parameters displayed in the Capture &  Adjust  to  the  Video  to
          Disk's .ini file.  This is primarily intended so that the camera's expo-
          sure, gain, and similar parameters in effect during the sequence capture
          are  saved  along with the image data.  The specific parameters saved is
          dependent  on  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber  and  camera  being   used.
          (20-Sep-2011)

     42.  Improved Feature: Integer, non-decimal, constants in numeric expressions
          are now shown and  entered  in  the  more  obvious  form  `1234(base16)'
          instead of prefix coded with `0x' for base 16, `0b' for base 2, etc.  An
          xcap.ini option allows reversion to the previous format.  (15-Dec-2011)

     43.  Improved Feature: The Palette, in Black & Gain mode, now allows  setting
          Black  and  White  levels,  as an alternative to setting Black Level and
          Gain.  (03-May-2012)

     44.  Improved Feature: The per-pixel defect correction,  available  for  some
          cameras  as  part  of  per-pixel  normalization, now also corrects for 2
          adjacent bad pixels (monochrome cameras only).  The feature  now  allows
          saving a list of defective pixel coordinates as a text file, and loading
          a list of defective pixel coordinates from a text file.  (07-Jun-2012)

     45.  Improved Feature: The PIXCI(R) SV7 now offers a square pixel option (see
          PIXCI  Open/Close,  Camera & Format).  However, unlike the PIXCI(R) SV5,
          the option involves software resizing of the frame  buffer.   Therefore,
          as for Bayer format frame buffers, `serious' image processing, graphics,
          and/or analysis might be better done by first making a duplicate of  the
          image, rather than modifying the underlying frame buffer.  (11-Jul-2012)

     46.  Improved  Feature:  Includes  Beta support for Linux V3.x kernels.  How-
          ever, the current Hardlock driver does not work w. V3.x kernels,  limit-
          ing XCAP's functionality to that of XCAP-Lite.  (05-Sep-2012)

     47.  Improved  Feature:  XCAP-Demo (i.e. w/out Hardlock key, without software
          activation  code)  now  allows  loading  and  viewing  image  and  image
          sequences from files!  (Regardless of whether a PIXCI(R) is open - which
          XCAP-Demo doesn't support).  This allows playing  video  to  disk  files
          (.vif),  and unlike other multi-media players, allows playing .avi files
          while controlling the playback rate.  XCAP-Lite &  XCAP-Ltd  now  allows
          the same (regardless of whether a PIXCI(R) is installed and open - which
          previously was required).












                                         - 6 -



             XCAP-Demo is now labeled XCAP-Viewer.  (19-Sep-2012).

     48.  Improved Feature: The  Clear  Frame  Buffers  on  Format  Change  option
          enables  clearing  (i.e.  set to zero) of frame buffer memory and memory
          used for recording per frame buffer's capture status whenever  the  cap-
          ture  format  resolution, bit depth, bit packing, or color space options
          are changed.  This is intended so that display of the  contents  of  the
          frame  buffer(s),  under  the  new format but before a new image is cap-
          tured, will show a black image (or green for YUYV formats)  rather  than
          `garbled'  pixel data.  This option is ignored when using forceful image
          frame buffer allocation, or for PIXCI(R) CL3SD and  SI2  frame  grabbers
          with on-board frame buffer memory.  (05-Oct-2012)

     49.  Improved  Feature: The PIXCI(R) CL3SD is now supported under 64 bit Win-
          dows and Linux.  (26-Oct-2012).

     50.  Version 3.8 released, adding support for Windows 8 32/64-Bit.  Also adds
          support  for  Linux  3.x  kernels (however Hardlock USB keys are not yet
          supported under 3.x).  Has completed support for  PIXCI(R)  E8CAM  along
          with the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2KS-C, 2KS-M camera.  (12-Dec-2012).

     51.  Fixed Feature: For Windows 7 & 8 64-Bit, the V3.8 PIXCI(R) frame grabber
          driver was not accepted due to digital signature  issues;  an  error  is
          shown in the Device Manager.  (26-Dec-2012)

     52.  New Feature: Now supports PIXCI(R) D3XE.  (24-Jan-2013)

     53.  Added  Feature:  The `Pixie Copy' feature allows copying color component
          values within each pixel.  For example, it can create  monochrome  pixel
          values identical to the original pixel's green value.  (14-May-2013)

     54.  Improved Feature: The `Full Screen' now supports multiple monitors, dis-
          playing full screen of whichever monitor the image  viewer  appears  on.
          (21-May-2013)

     55.  Fixed  Feature:  Recent  versions  of 32-bit XCAP for Windows may not be
          able to save PIXCI(R) Open/Close, Advanced parameters  to  the  registry
          when run on 64-bit Windows.  (10-Jun-2013).

     56.  Improved  Feature:  The  Black  Board's  `Attributes', `Connections' now
          allows filtering incoming values, discarding imported values that  don't
          contain  a  desired  string or that don't satisfy a Mathematical Expres-
          sion.  (22-Jul-2013)

     57.  Fixed Feature: The `Install Authorization key driver' may  not  work  on
          Windows 7 & 8, reporting `Unsupported Operating System', unless XCAP was
          started in Vista compatibility mode.  However, this feature isn't needed
          on  most  systems  as the drivers are automatically loaded by the Device
          Manager when the USB key is detected.  (23-Jul-2013)













                                         - 7 -



     58.  Improved Feature: Under Linux: The Driver  Assistant  now  installs  via
          /etc/rc)  the  PIXCI(R)  and  authorization key drivers so that they are
          automatically loaded when Linux boots, rather than loading them only via
          the Driver Assistant or when XCAP is started.  One benefit is for appli-
          cations which use XCLIB but not XCAP.   Configuration  options  for  the
          PIXCI(R)  driver  are  now  stored  in /etc/default/pixci rather than in
          XCAP's pixci.ini file (however, as before, this file merely contains the
          configuration  options  to be passed as a parameter via insmod; the file
          is not directly read by the driver).  The XCAP  installer  now,  option-
          ally, creates a desktop shortcut to start XCAP.  (16-Aug-2013)

     59.  Improved  Feature: Now includes final support for SILICON VIDEO(R) 1C45,
          1M45, and 15C5 cameras.  (02-Sep-2013)

     60.  Improved Feature: Hardlock USB keys are now supported  under  Linux  3.x
          kernels.   In  addition to a newer aksusbd, the hasp.rules must be added
          to /etc/udev/rules.d and the system rebooted.  Use of the dinst  instal-
          lation script is suggested.  (02-Sep-2013)

     61.  Improved  Feature: Under Linux, XCAP's shared libraries (i.e.  *.so) are
          now compiled w. LSB (Linux System Base) tools, rather  than  the  native
          GNU  tools  provided  with  a  selected Linux distribution.  This should
          eliminate GLIBC compatibility issues when the libraries are used on var-
          ious Linux distributions.  (24-Sep-2013)

     62.  Improved  Feature:  The  menu `Help' now offers links to PIXCI(R) User's
          Manuals and SILICON VIDEO(R) User's Manuals on the www.epixinc.com  web-
          site.  (08-Oct-2013)

     63.  Improved  Feature:  The  new  `Tap Correction: User Defined ...'  allows
          applying different multi-tap correction algorithms;  particularly  algo-
          rithms not yet built into the PIXCI(R) libraries.  (14-Oct-2013)

     64.  Improved  Feature:  The  new `Copy & Reorder' is similar to `Tap Correc-
          tion: User Defined ...', above, but also allows the source and  destina-
          tion image sizes to differ.  (19-Dec-2013)

     65.  Improved  Feature: Instead of entering a filename for saving an image or
          image sequence, a unique file name can be  automatically  generated  via
          right-click and Stamp Date & Time.  (00-Feb-2014)

     66.  Improved Feature: After entering a file name pattern for loading or sav-
          ing a sequence of images, the scan to check whether any such files exist
          is  now quicker.  Also, a pop-up dialog now announces and allows cancel-
          ing the scanning process.  (00-Feb-2014)

     67.  Improved Feature: When saving an image (or script, or any other type  of
          file)  if  a  directory in the path does not exist, a pop-up dialog will
          inquire whether to create the directory.  (08-Feb-2014)

     68.  Fixed Feature: Linux versions of XCAP would not allow loading .vif files
          larger  than  4 GB.  (08-Apr-2014) Improved Feature: When used with cam-
          eras for which XCAP has integrated  camera  controls,  images  saved  in
          TIFF,  AVI,  JPEG, and FITS formats can now, easily, include the current
          camera settings.  Previously, such as feature required XCAP-Std and  its
          Black Board feature.  (22-May-2014)

     69.  Improved  Feature:  A  virtual  COM port driver is now available for use
          with PIXCI(R) Camera Link frame grabbers for Windows XP and  later,  The
          virtual  COM  port  driver is not needed by XCAP, but allows third party
          applications to communicate with Camera Link cameras.  install  via  the
          Driver's Assistant.  (30-Jun-2014)

     70.  Improved Feature: The Driver Assistant's option to install a Camera Link
          Serial DLL now allows overriding the default installation  directory  by
          choosing  whether  the  V1.0,  V1.1,  or  V2.0 Camera Link specification
          should be followed.  This choice is  independent  of  which  DLL  is  to
          installed,  as  some  camera  manufacturer  software  has  been found to
          require, for example, a V1.1 API DLL installed as per the V1.0  specifi-
          cation.  (30-Jun-2014)

     71.  Improved  Feature:  An  `Apply Palette at - Auto Select' option has been
          added to the `Apply Palette at Image's Bit Depth' vs `Apply  Palette  at
          Display's Bit Depth' options.  The automatic selection minimizes display
          overhead, where possible, and automatically switches  to  avoid  banding
          effects, when necessary.  (22-Jul-2014)

     72.  Improved  Feature: For Camera Link cameras with serial controls, and for
          SILICON VIDEO(R) cameras with I2C  controls,  the  serial  communication
          will  always  be  retried  each  time  the PIXCI(R) is re-opened (unless
          Serial Mode
           was set to Offline), even if communication previously failed  (such  as
          due  to  not  having  the  the camera connected) and Open with last used
          Video Setup was selected.  In short: the Serial Connect button need  not
          be clicked so as to recover from not having the camera connected or pow-
          ered on.  (23-Oct-2014)

     73.  Version 3.8 supports Windows 10, a new release  of  XCAP  isn't  needed.
          (31-Jul-2015)

     74.  Improved Feature: The `TWAIN Select Source' and `TWAIN New Acquire' fea-
          tures are now available  under  64-bit  Windows.   The  `PIXCI(R)  TWAIN
          Sourcery'  feature  and  the corresponding TWAIN Data Source (i.e. TWAIN
          `driver') is now available for 64-bit  Windows.   A  new  `TWAIN  Source
          Info'  provides  information  about the currently selected TWAIN source.
          (07-Dec-2015)

     75.  Improved Feature: The Video to Disk and Video to  Image  Files  features
          now  provide  a Auto File Name upon Record option - auto-generating file
          names  and  patterns  each  time   the   Record   button   is   clicked.

          (22-Dec-2015)

     76.  Improved  Feature:  PIXCI(R)  epixxcs2.sys  and epixxcs6.sys drivers for
          Windows are now signed with the new SHA-2 algorithm,  as  Microsoft  now
          requires  for  Windows  7  and  later for any drivers created in 2016 or
          later.  Note that Windows 7 requires an update  to  use  drivers  signed
          with   SHA-2;  see  Microsoft's  `Microsoft  ccccccknlSecurity  Advisory
          2949927' and `Microsoft Security Advisory 3033929'.  Windows Vista  also
          requires an update; see `Microsoft Article ID 2763674'.  (01-Jan-2016)

     77.  Improved  Feature:  Supports  the  PIXCI(R)  EB1tg frame generator (i.e.
          phantom Camera Link camera).  As a specialty card, the PIXCI(R) EB1tg is
          not mentioned in the XCAP documentation.  (05-Jan-2016)

     78.  Added  Feature:  The  menu bar may now be removed from the image display
          window, either via View or Program Setup.   With  menu  bar  removed,  a
          mouse right-click can be used to up the menu, select any feature, and/or
          restore the menu bar.  (11-Apr-2016)

     79.  Improved Feature: Saving and loading of image  sequences  in  TIFF  (one
          file  per sequence or one file per image) is now available in XCAP-Lite;
          these features previously required XCAP-Ltd or XCAP-Std.  (04-May-2016)

     80.  Improved Feature: PIXCI(R) epixxcs2.sys  and  epixxcs6.sys  drivers  for
          Windows  are  now also provided with only SHA-1 signatures, for use with
          Windows XP or Vista and where Windows has not  been  updated  to  accept
          newer signatures.  (24-May-2016)

     81.  Improved Feature: The Full Screen display feature is now available under
          Linux and with XCAP-Lite, albeit with the window  frame  still  visible.
          Exit from Full Screen display mode now uses a mouse right-click to popup
          a menu.  For images smaller than screen resolution, the displayed  image
          is now centered on the screen.  (06-Jun-2016)

     82.  New  Feature:  Support  for the nVidia TX1 with ARM Cortex-A57 processor
          running a 64 bit Linux kernel and 64 bit applications  has  been  added.
          (The  preliminary  version of Linux for TX1 with 64 bit Linux kernel and
          32 bit applications is not supported).  XCAP for nVidia TX1 is primarily
          intended  as  a  configuration  tool  for  XCLIB  and  also provides the
          PIXCI(R) drivers; only XCAP-Lite is supported.  XCAP for nVidia TX1 does
          not  include  a  Java  Runtime  Environment (JRE), the Linux default JRE
          should be installed.  (11-Jul-2016)

     83.  New  Feature:  Now  supports  the  SILICON   VIDEO(R)   1820CL   camera.
          (19-Aug-2016)

     84.  Improved  Feature: For selected Examine, Modify, and Measure operations,
          the new Use Stack of Images  (under  Set  AOI/ROI)  allows  selecting  a
          `stack'  of  several  image  buffers to be processed, analyzed, saved or
          loaded, as if a single image.   For  example,  this  allows  creating  a

          single Histogram of an entire image sequence.  (17-Nov-2016)

     85.  Improved  Feature:  Under  Windows 8 & 10, the kernel's new `System Time
          Precise' timer can now be selected for time stamping images.  In partic-
          ular,  this simplifies reading of .vif files in third-party software and
          decoding its time stamps.  (09-Dec-2016)

     86.  Installation Note: Newer PIXCI(R) epixxcw6.sys drivers on some  releases
          of  Windows  10  64  bit may not load due to new Microsoft `Secure Boot'
          policies.  See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/commer-
          cialize/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot  for  instructions  on
          disabling Windows' secure boot.  (06-Feb-2017)

     87.  New Feature: Support for the nVidia TK1 with ARM Cortex-A15 32 bit  pro-
          cessor  has  been added.  XCAP for nVidia TK1 is primarily intended as a
          configuration tool for XCLIB and also  provides  the  PIXCI(R)  drivers;
          only  XCAP-Lite  is  supported.   XCAP for nVidia TK1 does not include a
          Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE),  the  Linux  default  JRE  should  be
          installed.  (10-Feb-2017)

     88.  Improved  Feature:  PIXCI(R)  drivers identified as being for Windows 10
          are are now signed with a Extended Validation (`EV') Code  Signing  Cer-
          tificate.   The new (`EV') Certificate is not used for drivers for older
          versions  of  Windows,  so  as   to   ensure   backward   compatibility.
          (27-Mar-2017)

     89.  Improved  Feature:  When  installed under Linux using the `Shared Files'
          option, the installer now configures XCAP's `data', `labels', `scripts',
          `settings', `tmp', and `ini' directories to allow r/w by any user, along
          with any files created (recursively) within those directories.  (Setting
          permissions  affecting  subdirectories  requires  the optional Linux ACL
          features to have been installed).  04-Apr-2017

     90.  Improved Feature: The Video to Disk and Video to  Image  Files  features
          now  provide a `Auto Protect after Record' option, automatically setting
          Write Protect after recording, so as to help  prevent  overwriting  cap-
          tured images.  (06-Apr-2017)

     91.  Improved  Feature:  PIXCI(R)  drivers identified as being for Windows 10
          are are now co-signed by Microsoft so as to allow loading by newer  Win-
          dows 10 64 bit desktop systems.  (20-Apr-2017)

     92.  Added  Feature: Support for the Boundary Devices NITROGEN6/imx6 with ARM
          processor has been added.  (01-Jul-2017)

     93.  New  Feature:  Now  supports  the  SILICON   VIDEO(R)   1514CL   camera.
          (13-Oct-2017)

     94.  Improved  Feature:  The Subpixel Edger now allows measuring the position
          of `lines' (i.e. narrow two boundary feature)  in  addition  to  `edges'

     95.  Improved  Feature:  XCAP  for Linux i386 can now be run on Linux x86-64,
          requiring and including 64-bit drivers.  (27-Mar-2018)

     96.  Fixed Feature: On i386 machines, the USB authorization key  may  not  be
          detected if the machine does not have a parallel port.  (29-Mar-2018)

     97.  Improved  Feature: Support added to save & load Portable Bit Map, Porta-
          ble Gray Map, and Portable Pixel Map image  file  formats  (i.e.   .pbm,
          .pgm, and .ppm).  (21-Aug-2018)

     98.  Improved  Feature:  New parameters in Program Setup, GUI, allow limiting
          XCAP's use of display screen `real estate'; this is particularly  useful
          on  high  resolution  `letterbox' graphic displays which are much larger
          and wider than needed.  The Image Viewer Window, or  any  other  window,
          can be explicitly enlarged as needed; the Image Viewer Window also has a
          new Fill Screen option.  (21-Nov-2018)

     99.  Improved Feature: The Pixel Peek now allows displaying of  pixel  values
          across  frame buffers; i.e. displaying numeric values from a 2-d `slice'
          of the 3-d data.  The Pixel Peek now allows displaying  bar  graphs  and
          `trends'  of  pixel  values.  Saving of data from Pixel Peek is now sup-
          ported in XCAP-Lite.  (16-Jan-2019)

    100.  Improved Feature: XCAP-Lite now supports up to 256 Mbyte of frame buffer
          memory (instead of 64 Mbyte).  (12-Mar-2019)

    101.  New  Feature:  Support  for the nVidia Xavier with ARM Cortex-A57 64 bit
          processor has been added.  XCAP for nVidia Xavier is primarily  intended
          as  a  configuration tool for XCLIB and also provides the PIXCI(R) driv-
          ers; only XCAP-Lite is supported.   XCAP  for  nVidia  Xavier  does  not
          include  a  Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Linux default JRE should
          be installed.  (17-Apr-2019)

    102.  Improved Feature: The Examine, Pixel Plot now provides options to select
          the  image buffer (rather than tracking the current buffer) and provides
          graphing image lines and columns as they vary across frame buffers.  The
          Examine,  Pixel  Plot now allows showing the recent trends of pixel val-
          ues, as an fading `echo,' to help visually evaluate the fluctuations  of
          live video.  or the effects of camera adjustments.  (04-Jun-2019).

    103.  New  Feature:  For  PIXCI(R)  frame grabbers using an EEPROM specify the
          default camera or video submodel (or preset): and option  to  `sanitize'
          the  EEPROM  has been added.  Unused areas of the EEPROM are zero'ed, so
          as to help prevent its use for illicit storage and transfer of  informa-
          tion.  (18-Jun-2019)

    104.  Fixed  Feature.   Changes  to Windows 10.0.18362.418 prevent the virtual
          COM port driver from being installed (although a driver installed  prior

          to updating Windows would continue to work).  (23-Oct-2019)

    105.  New  Feature:  XCAP  for  Linux  now  includes  a Video for Linux (V4L2)
          driver, installable via the Driver Assistant.  The V4L2  driver  is  not
          needed by XCAP, but allows simple integration of PIXCI(R) frame grabbers
          into GStreamer, Matlab and  other  programming  environments  supporting
          V4L2;  allows  use  of  `vlc'  and other third party image/video display
          applications; and provides an alternative API for creating custom appli-
          cations  incorporating  PIXCI(R) frame grabbers.  Install via the Driver
          Assistant.  (15-Jan-2020)

    106.  New Feature: Support for the PIXCI(R) EB1miniTg and the new  version  of
          the PIXCI(R)EB1Tg frame generators has been added.  (29-Jan-2020)

    107.  New  Feature:  XCAP now includes the TWAIN driver for the PIXCI(R) frame
          grabbers, rather than the TWAIN driver being  available  as  a  separate
          package.  The TWAIN driver is not needed by XCAP, but allows third party
          TWAIN compliant applications to  capture  images.   Ditto  the  ImagePro
          driver.    Either   can   be   installed   via   the  Driver  Assistant.
          (25-May-2020)

    108.  New Feature: Support for the nVidia Nano with ARM Cortex-A57 64 bit pro-
          cessor has been tested.  XCAP for nVidia Nano is primarily intended as a
          configuration tool for XCLIB and also  provides  the  PIXCI(R)  drivers;
          only  XCAP-Lite  is  supported.  XCAP for nVidia Nano does not include a
          Java  Runtime  Environment  (JRE),  the  Linux  default  JRE  should  be
          installed.  (26-May-2020)

    109.  Fixed Feature: XCAP's Driver Assistant was unable to install, update, or
          remove PIXCI(R) drivers on some versions of Windows 10; instead suggest-
          ing  use  of  the  Windows'  Device  Manager.  Ditto the XCAP installer.
          (23-Jun-2020)

    110.  New Feature: XCAP for Windows now  includes  a  Media  Foundation  Frame
          Server  driver  for  PIXCI(R) frame grabbers - providing a Windows Media
          Foundation Media Source driver to control PIXCI(R)  frame  grabbers  and
          retrieve video and image data.

             The  PIXCI(R)  Frame  Source driver is not needed by XCAP, but allows
          simple integration of PIXCI(R) frame grabbers into LabView,  Matlab  and
          other programming environments supporting Media Foundation[1] or Direct-
          Show API's; allows use of the Windows `Camera'  and  other  third  party
          image/video  display  applications;  and  provides an alternative to the
          XCLIB API for creating custom applications incorporating PIXCI(R)  frame
          grabbers.  Install via the Driver Assistant.  (13-Jul-2020)

    111.  New Feature: Support for the nVidia Xavier NX with ARM Cortex-A57 64 bit
          processor has been tested.   XCAP  for  nVidia  Xavier NX  is  primarily
          intended  as  a  configuration  tool  for  XCLIB  and  also provides the
          PIXCI(R)  drivers;  only  XCAP-Lite  is  supported.   XCAP  for   nVidia

          Xavier NX  does  not include a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Linux
          default JRE should be installed.  (15-Jul-2020)

    112.  Improved Feature: The XCAP de-installer no longer defaults to  prompting
          for each removal action.  (22-Oct-2020)

    113.  Note:  XCAP  for Windows now verifies that its various executable utili-
          ties, drivers, and code have the correct  `signature'  for  the  instant
          version.   Failure will post a `Bad module(s) signature' error; the most
          common cause is interruption of the XCAP installation resulting in files
          which are missing or reflect a combination of XCAP versions or releases.

    114.  Note: In XCAP for Windows released circa 7 Dec 2020 thru  20  Dec  2020,
          the  Windows 10 drivers, while signed by EPIX, Inc with SHA2EV and coun-
          tersigned by Microsoft, may not be accepted by the Device Manager (error
          code  52),  depending  on  the  specific  Windows  10  release  in  use.
          (21-Dec-2020)

    115.  Improved Feature: For XCAP for Linux, in  conjunction  with  many  Linux
          distributions  supporting  `gnome terminal' or `xterm', now allows using
          XCAP's Driver Assistant without  running  XCAP  as  super-user.   XCAP's
          Driver  Assistant  will  instead  open  a `terminal' window, have `sudo'
          prompt the user for the appropriate password, and have the  `sudo'  exe-
          cute a prepared shell script.  This allows using XCAP's Driver Assistant
          on Linux distributions which prohibit the running  of  GUI  applications
          with  super-user  status, and avoids running the entire XCAP application
          as super-user.

             XCAP can still be run as super-user; this may be more convenient when
          installing  or  configuring  several of the Driver Assistant's features.
          (04-Jan-2021)

    116.  Improved Feature: For XCAP for Windows, using Vista and later with  User
          Account Control (UAC), now allows using XCAP's Driver Assistant features
          without running XCAP as Administrator (i.e.  `elevated').  XCAP's Driver
          Assistant  will instead open a User Account Control (UAC) dialog, asking
          the user for permissions as needed.  This avoid running the entire  XCAP
          application as Administrator.

             XCAP  can still be run as Administrator; which may be more convenient
          when installing or configuring several of the  Driver  Assistant's  fea-
          tures.  (19-Jan-2021)

    117.  Improved  Feature:  Under  Windows 7 and later with User Account Control
          (UAC), the XCAP installer (which runs in Administrator (i.e.  `elevated'
          mode) will now de-elevate before starting XCAP.

             Under Linux, the XCAP installer (which is normally run as super-user)
          will now run XCAP as the  login  user,  instead  of  defaulting  to  the












                                        - 14 -



          installer's user id.

             This avoids the default and unnecessary running of XCAP with elevated
          or super-user privileges.  (19-Jan-2021)

    118.  Modified Feature: The Multiple Devices will no longer set  the  PIXCI(R)
          driver's  persistent  (i.e.  after re-boot) configuration, but will only
          set the configuration used by XCAP.  This avoids annoying  warning  mes-
          sages and/or popup `sudo' or `UAC' dialogs if XCAP is run without super-
          user or Administrator privileges.  The driver's persistent configuration
          can  still  be  changed  via  the  Advanced or Driver Assistant dialogs.
          (19-Jan-2021)

    119.  Improved Feature: For PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, and SV5  the  interrelated
          Chroma  U  Gain  Mod.  and Chroma V Gain Mod.  controls in the Capture &
          Adjust dialog have been replaced by a single Saturation  Mod.   control.
          The  few applications using individual chroma gains can use the PIXCI(R)
          Video Setup.  (22-Mar-2021)

    120.  Note: In the 12/2020 release of XCAP for Linux on i386 and  x86-64,  the
          PIXCI(R)  driver's  `5.4  Binary Blob' was not updated and is the 6/2020
          version.  (07-Apr-2021)

    121.  Improved Feature: XCAP-Std and XCAP-Ltd now use a new  model  of  autho-
          rization  key.   Unlike  the  old  key, this key does not have the issue
          under Windows whereby the key is not recognized if XCAP is  started  via
          remote  desktop.   (The workaround, having XCAP auto-started by Windows,
          is not always convenient).  Under Linux on x86-64 platforms, the new key
          does  not require installation of IA32 compatibility libraries.  To dis-
          tinguish keys: old USB keys are blue,  new  USB  keys  are  green.   New
          releases of XCAP accept either old or new keys.  (06-May-2021)

    122.  New Feature: For selected cameras, XCAP-Std and XCAP-Ltd now offer auto-
          matic image contrast enhancement as part of the video processing  stream
          and  enabled  in the Capture & Adjust dialog This is typically used with
          cameras outputting `raw' pixel values without in-camera black level cor-
          rection or contrast correction - typically cameras for infrared (IR) and
          scientific applications.  (01-Jun-2021)

    123.  Improved Feature: The Video to Image Files now supports use of the  FITS
          file format, with one file per image.  (14-Jul-2021)

    124.  Improved  Feature:  The new Resize: Pixel Replication/Decimation display
          mode uses (only) pixel replication or decimation.   Similar  to  Resize:
          None  (Image Pixel = Display Pixel), any possible resizing artifacts are
          avoided and is best used with images of square pixels (i.e. same as  the
          display's  pixels).   But  the  Resize: Pixel Replication/Decimation can
          enlarge the image display, and thus produces a better result when  using
          a  high  resolution  display  with  a  low  or  medium resolution image.

                                        - 15 -



    125.  New Feature: Under View, the new Flip & Mirror  option  allows  flipping
          and  mirroring  the  displayed  image so that the top is oriented to the
          top, left, right, or bottom.  (03-Sep-2021)

    126.  Fixed Feature: The Driver Assistant, when  installing  Media  Foundation
          Frame  Server  drivers  for two or more devices, does not prompt for UAC
          elevation;   XCAP   must   be   run   with   administrator   privileges.
          (28-Sep-2021)

    127.  Note:  The  current  release  of  XCAP V3.8 supports the new Windows 11,
          using the same drivers as for Windows 10.  (06-Oct-2021)

    128.  Improved Feature: Under Multiple Devices, the  new  Select  All  Devices
          allows convenient selection of all installed boards; further, the selec-
          tion  is  updated  automatically  as  boards  are  added   or   removed.
          (25-Oct-2021)

    129.  Improved Feature: The Pixel Peek now offers an X Plank of Buffers option
          -- displaying the content of image buffers as if they concatenated hori-
          zontally -- to complement the Y Stack of Buffers option.  Similarly, the
          Pixel Plot now offers an Plank of Buffers option to complement its Stack
          of Buffers option.  (27-Oct-2021)

    130.  Improved  Feature: Image & video display now has an option to use multi-
          ple threads/CPU's so as to increase the display rate.  Use  of  multiple
          threads/CPU's  is  particularly useful in conjunction with video formats
          that require significant post-capture processing, such as pixel reorder-
          ing, Bayer conversion, color space correction, and/or per-pixel FPN/PRNU
          corrections.   Or  when  displaying  to  a  high   resolution   monitor.
          (15-Nov-2021)

    131.  New Feature: The new Pixel Magnifier allows enlarging the view of a por-
          tion of the image, with an effect similar to  using  a  magnifying  lens
          over  the  display.  In contrast to Zoom, Pan, Scroll which enlarges the
          entire image -- creating a (virtual) larger image of which a section  is
          viewed  via pan and scroll.  The Magnifier can be used `on top of' Zoom;
          multiple Magnifiers can be used on a single  image  in  different  posi-
          tions.  (16-Dec-2021)

    132.  Improved Feature: The Sequence Thumbnails now provides easier adjustment
          of thumbnail size, options to eliminate the menu bar and scroll bar, and
          options to adjust the thumbnail border and spacing - all allowing trade-
          off between convenience or thumbnail size versus the  number  of  thumb-
          nails displayed (without scrolling).  (17-Dec-2021)

    133.  Improved  Feature:  Under  Linux,  the  Pixel  Peek,  Plot  2D, Plot 3D,
          Viewer's Palette and similar windows were not - to the desktop manager -
          `children' of the Image Viewer Window and would not be forced to be dis-
          played on top of the Image Viewer Window.  (21-Dec-2021)













                                        - 16 -



    134.  Fixed Feature: Changing the PIXCI(R) driver's persistent `unit' configu-
          ration  via  the  Advanced  or Driver Assistant dialogs did not have any
          effect.  (18-Jan-2022)

    135.  Improved Feature: For selected Examine, Modify, and Measure  operations,
          the  new Use Average Image Stack allows selecting the average (of corre-
          sponding pixels) of several image buffers to be processed, analyzed,  or
          saved as a single image.  (10-Mar-2022)

    136.  Improved  Feature:  Although Windows 7 reached end of support on Jan 14,
          2020, Microsoft changed driver signature requirements effective June 17,
          2021.   The  driver  files  epixxcw6.sys and epixxcw6.cat are now signed
          with SHA-2 by `Microsoft Windows  Hardware  Compatibilty  Publisher'  as
          required  by  Microsoft,  instead  of by `EPIX, Inc.'.  Microsoft hasn't
          made it clear whether Windows 7 requires  installation  of  all  service
          packs  and  updates  in order to accept these drivers, but it is likely.
          (30-Mar-2022)

    137.  Improved Feature: The X/Y Ascii format of the  Image  Save  feature  now
          allows  saving  the current camera settings and/or Capture & Adjust set-
          tings as text.  This is analogous to Image Save's other format  options,
          which  allows  saving  the  settings  as  a comment in the image's file.
          (09-May-2022)

    138.  Improved Feature: When saving Images in JPEG format, a new option allows
          selecting use of more than one CPU or thread to perform the compression.
          On computers with multiple CPUs or cores, this feature  can  reduce  the
          time   required  to  perform  JPEG  compression  and  save  each  image.
          (23-May-2022)

    139.  Fixed Feature: Previously, the XCAP for Windows installer was changed so
          that  when  auto-starting XCAP after installation, XCAP would not be run
          with the installer's elevated privileges.  Previously, XCAP for  Windows
          was  changed  so that it need not run with elevated privileges; instead,
          the Driver Assistant would (ask Windows to) prompt for elevated  permis-
          sions  as  needed.  But, the de-elevated XCAP run by installer could not
          re-elevate.  Fixed so  that  the  de-elevated  XCAP  can  re-elevate  as
          needed.  (31-May-2022)

    140.  Improved Feature: When saving Images in TIFF format, a new option allows
          selecting use of more than one CPU or thread to perform the compression.
          On  computers  with  multiple CPUs or cores, this feature can reduce the
          time  required  to  perform  TIFF  compression  and  save  each   image.
          (25-Jun-2022)

    141.  Improved  Feature: Images and image sequences can now be saved or loaded
          using the BigTIFF format.  Classic TIFF is limited to  a  file  size  of
          4 GiByte  (232  bytes);  BigTiff  supports a file size of 16 EiByte (264
          bytes).  XCAP's support of BigTIFF provides  the  same  compression  and
          multi-thread options as for classic TIFF.  (11-Jul-2022)












                                        - 17 -



    142.  Modified  Feature:  Options  for  saving images in PCX and Targa formats
          have been hidden.  These formats are now archaic; and, as XCAP never had
          (obvious)  support  for  loading  these  images, saving but not (easily)
          reloading may cause disappointment.  (12-Oct-2022)

    143.  Improved Feature: Image sequences can now be saved and loaded using  the
          FITS file format.  (14-Oct-2022)

    144.  Improved  Feature: Image sequences can now be saved and loaded using the
          AVI file format with a MJPG codec and lossy compression.  The  Video  to
          Image  Files  also  now  supports use of the AVI file format with a MJPG
          codec.   These  allow   `one   step'   creation   of   compact   movies.
          (04-Nov-2022)

    145.  Fixed  Feature: A recent update of Windows 10 broke the XCAP installer's
          ability  to  autostart  XCAP  after  the  completion  of   installation.
          (05-Jan-2023)

    146.  Fixed  Feature:  The  Download  New Release feature, under Windows, with
          certain system configurations, might change the XCAP  shortcut's  `Start
          In' directory to be the same as the `Target' directory (which would then
          need to be manually changed).  Aside from the inconvenience of  changing
          the  default  directory for image files, scripts, etc., under Windows 10
          or 11 the `Target' directory (sub)directories are typically  write  pro-
          tected  (except  by  admin)  leading  to  errors  when  XCAP updates its
          `xcap.ini' file.  (10-Jan-2023)

    147.  Improved Feature: The driver for Green authorization USB keys  has  been
          updated, and can now be used with Windows 11 `Memory Integrity' enabled.
          (16-Jan-2023)

    148.  Improved Feature: XCAP-Ltd and XCAP-Std are now available for ARM  plat-
          forms  in  conjunction  with  a Green authorization USB key.  Installing
          `apt-get install libusb-dev' may be required.  (26-Jan-2023)

    149.  Improved Feature: The Video to Image Files now extends  support  of  the
          FITS  and  TIFF  file formats, with the image sequence saved in a single
          file instead of one image per file.  (06-Feb-2023)

    RELEASE NOTES: XCAP  -- Version 2.0, V2.1, V2.2

      1.  Version 2.0 released.  (09-Mar-2000).

      2.  Modified feature: Printing of images, graphics, and screen  capture  has
          been  improved  to be both quicker and require less temporary space (the
          later minimizing a Windows message that the spooler  temporary  file  is
          full,  which  may  occur  when printing onto a large area of the paper).
          (07-Apr-2000).














                                        - 18 -



      3.  Added feature: Under Utility, Devices ..., support for  controlling  the
          Volpi  intralux  dc-1100  and  the  Illumination Technologies 3900 light
          sources through their RS-232 ports has been added.  (12-Apr-2000).

      4.  Modified feature: XCAP no longer requires re-entering of the software ID
          when  a  different  user  logs into a computer where XCAP was previously
          installed.  XCAP can still, optionally, provide multiple users with dis-
          tinct last used settings.  (02-May-2000).

      5.  Improved  Feature.   XCAP's default size and position now does not cover
          the task bar.  (09-May-2000).

      6.  Added Feature.   The  Utility,  Program  Setup,  Start/End  now  allows,
          a) Configuring  XCAP  as  a  Windows  background  task, b) Automatically
          starting XCAP when Windows boots, and c) Automatically  minimizing  XCAP
          on startup.  (12-May-2000).

      7.  Added  Feature.   An  XCAP Uninstall feature, accessible from the  "XCAP
          Imaging" group has been added.  (23-May-2000).

      8.  Improved Feature.  Text and numeric fields now provide Cut, Copy, Paste,
          and Delete editing and Clipboard controls.  (26-May-2000).

      9.  Improved  Feature.  There is now a single XCAP shortcut, or entry in the
          Start, Programs, XCAP Imaging group for the Windows 95/98  version,  for
          the   Windows   NT   version,   and   for   the  Windows  2000  version.
          (04-Jun-2000).

     10.  Added Feature.  The Utility, Program Setup, Start/End now  allows  auto-
          matically  switching  to  Live mode on startup, if the 'Open PIXCI(R) on
          Startup' is also selected.  (06-Jun-2000).

     11.  Improved Feature.  XCAP-Std and XCAP-Plus, which require  an  authoriza-
          tion  key,  can now be ordered with a USB port authorization key instead
          of the default printer port authorization key.  (15-Jun-2000).

     12.  Improved Feature.  The Video to Disk has been improved to  use  multiple
          I/O  buffers  and  to  use asynchronous I/O (subject to operating system
          support).  These changes allow successful recording with disk subsystems
          whose  average  bandwidth,  but not `instantaneous' bandwidth, is suffi-
          ciently high.  Other improvements allow using Video to Disk with cameras
          operating in single-shot trigger modes.  (19-Jun-2000).

     13.  Improved  Feature:  The  hints which appear when the mouse hovers over a
          shortcut now are popup windows, rather than appearing in the status bar.
          The  status  bar,  with  cursor coordinates, buffer number, etc.  is now
          under the displayed image instead of the detached shortcuts.  The status
          bar can be hidden via View, Display, Windows.  (30-Jul-2000).

     14.  Improved  Feature:  The TWAIN and Image-Pro Sourcery's activation of the
          video preview window has been `tuned' to improve  cooperation  with  the
          TWAIN  or  Image-Pro  application  -  forcing XCAP to the foreground and
          TWAIN or Image-Pro to the background, until the  preview  is  completed.
          Also,  when  a  full  screen  XCAP  preview  is  chosen  and the TWAIN's
          Acquire/Cancel buttons or Image-Pro's Snap/Stop Preview buttons are hid-
          den,  XCAP  now  offer's  replacement controls (under the Capture Menu),
          allowing these features to be clicked without having  to  `dig'  through
          overlapping  Windows  for  the  TWAIN  or Image-Pro copy of the buttons.
          (07-Aug-2000).

     15.  Improved Feature: Using the PIXCI(R) Video Setup for line  scan  cameras
          has  been improved, allowing the number of lines acquired to be adjusted
          from the Resolution portion, and avoiding having to use the Custom  por-
          tion.  (09-Aug-2000).

     16.  Fixed  Feature:  The  Shape Analysis using a rectangular window shape (a
          shape for which the analysis is trivial and useless,  but  unfortunately
          the  default  shape),  would  yield  invalid  results  or  a page fault.
          (14-Aug-2000).

     17.  Fixed Feature: With Spatial Calibration enabled, the Annulus, Elliptical
          Annulus  and  Rectangular  Frame graphic types did not always draw prop-
          erly.  (14-Aug-2000).

     18.  Fixed Feature: The Pixel Plot, in column mode with color  images,  would
          occasionally cause page faults.  (23-Aug-2000).

     19.  Version   2.1   released,  using  new  PIXCI(R)  drivers  (epixxcw5.vxd,
          epixxcwt.sys).  (28-Aug-2000).

     20.  Improved Feature: Windows ME is now supported, although  currently  lim-
          ited   to   approximately   64  mbyte  of  image  frame  buffer  memory.
          (31-Aug-2000).

     21.  Fixed Feature: Under some  versions  of  NT,  opening  the  Message  Log
          (explicitly, or implicitly due to message being produced) may cause XCAP
          to cease re-drawing its Windows.  (Work-around? Activate command  prompt
          window,  switch  to  full screen (Alt-Enter), switch back, close command
          prompt window.  (10-Sep-2000).

     22.  Improved Feature: Using Modify, Src+Dst style operation,  the  Set  AOI,
          Apply,  and  OK  buttons  stay greyed out, rather than greying with each
          operation  cycle.   While  this  eliminates  visual  feedback,  it  also
          decreases overhead for video rate processing.  (10-Sep-2000).

     23.  Fixed  Feature:  Using  the Driver Assistant under Windows NT or Windows
          2000 to `Request Forceful Frame Buffer Allocation'  may  leave  multiple
          `PIXCI(R)' boot lines within boot.ini.  (24-Sep-2000).

     24.  Improved  Feature: The Program Setup now has a `GUI' section from which,
          a) The `% Done / Abort' boxes seen during  length  processing  can  dis-
          abled,  b) The numeric field up/down `browse' buttons can be eliminated,
          c) The color field `browse swatch' buttons can be eliminated, and d) The
          shortcuts' tool tip can be disabled.  These save a small amount of over-
          head, primarily for applications where XCAP is being  used  non-interac-
          tively.  (29-Sep-2000).

     25.  Fixed  Feature:  The  shortcuts'  tool tips occasionally appeared if the
          mouse's cursor was only briefly over the shortcut, rather  than  waiting
          for the mouse to hover for (approx.) a second.  (29-Sep-2000).

     26.  Fixed  Feature:  The `E-Mail Image' feature would not work properly with
          some UNIX based SMTP servers.  The Program Setup,  `E-Mail  Name'  field
          (the  sender's  descriptive  name),  would  not  be remembered and used.
          (08-Oct-2000).

     27.  Fixed Feature: The Capture & Adjust feature's `Load  Preset'  and  `Save
          Preset' would not operate and would produce an indecipherable error mes-
          sage.  (12-Oct-2000).

     28.  Improved Feature: Two new options in Utility, Program Setup,  Start/End,
          `PIXCI(R) Viewer is Minimal TWAIN Sourcery' and `PIXCI(R) Viewer is Min-
          imal Image-Pro Sourcery', allow selecting a  simplified  PIXCI(R)  Image
          Viewer Window, suitable for supporting XCAP's use only as a component of
          a `smart' TWAIN  Source  (TWAIN  terminology)  or  Video/Digital  source
          (Image-Pro  terminology).  The new `Show TWAIN Popup Controls' option in
          PIXCI(R) TWAIN Sourcery allows eliminating the three button TWAIN  popup
          control window.  (19-Oct-2000).

     29.  Added  feature:  XCAP  now  supports  the PIXCI(R) D2X series of imaging
          boards.  (06-Nov-2000)

     30.  Improved Feature: The Save Image, Save Image Sequence,  and  Print  fea-
          tures now allow saving or printing the image as seen through the current
          palette.  This feature may be enabled or disabled via the Set  AOI  but-
          ton.   (06-Nov-2000).   The  Save  Image Sequence, Set AOI was broken by
          this new feature and fixed.  (21-Nov-2000)

     31.  Improved Feature: The File, Load New Image, and  File,  Load  Image  now
          allow  loading  images  directly from the internet, using an FTP or HTTP
          URL.  (08-Nov-2000).

     32.  Improved Feature: The Capture & Adjust for cameras with RS-232  controls
          now  provides  a  `RS-232 Log' feature.  When enabled, all commands sent
          to, or received from, the camera are displayed in the message log.  This
          is  useful  to  camera  designers  and  application  developers, who can
          observe the commands being sent to the camera for any mode of operation.
          (17-Nov-2000).

     33.  Improved Feature: The Pixel Peek, Pixel Plot, and Pixel Plot 3D features
          now allow viewing pixel values as  seen  through  the  current  palette.
          They  also  allow selectively disabling the previously supported feature
          whereby pixel values as mapped via the `Z=>I  Calibration'  feature  are
          shown.  (20-Nov-2000).

     34.  Fixed  Feature:  The  Pixel  Peek, with a color space selection of `R of
          BGR' or `B of BGR' would display the numerical values for `B of BGR'  or
          `R of BGR', respectively.  (21-Nov-2000).

     35.  Fixed  Feature:  The  Play  feature  of  Video to Disk did not function.
          (05-Dec-2000).

     36.  Fixed Feature: Loading of images from TIF, BMP, or JPG  files  into  BGR
          format image buffers may exchange red and blue colors.  RGB format image
          buffers are not affected.  (05-Dec-2000).

     37.  Improved Feature: The Video to Disk now supports the `Use Common  Format
          &  Controls w. Cameras Synchronized' options for multiple boards, allow-
          ing multiple video to disk streams to be  controlled  from  one  dialog.
          (04-Jan-2001).

     38.  Fixed  Feature:  Under  Windows NT (but not Windows 2000), activating an
          XCAP window which displays an image or graph may rarely produce  a  par-
          tially draw and inoperable `ghost' window.  (07-Jan-2001).

     39.  Improved  Features:  The  Sequence  Capture  and Video to Disk have been
          renamed to Video to Frame Buffers and Video to Disk File,  respectively,
          and  joined by a Video to Memory Buffers and a Video to Image Files fea-
          tures.

             These four sequence capture features provide a  range  of  speed  vs.
          convenience  vs. image count tradeoffs.  The Video to Frame Buffers cap-
          tures sequences directly into pre-configured frame  buffer  memory,  and
          can  support  any  video rate or bandwidth.  The Video to Memory Buffers
          captures and copies sequences into convenient dynamically allocated mem-
          ory,  but  may not support high video rate or bandwidth sequence capture
          for all cameras on all computers.  The Video to Disk File  captures  and
          copies  sequences  into  a  disk  file  in an efficient, internal format
          (after capture the sequence can be saved in  a  standard  format).   The
          Video  to  Image Files captures and copies sequences directly into stan-
          dard format image files, but may not obtain as high video  rate  capture
          as the Video to Disk File feature.

             The  Video  to  Frame Buffers now includes a sequence display feature
          (similar to that previously in Video to Disk File).  The Video  to  Disk
          File now includes a trigger feature (similar to that previously in Video
          to Frame Buffers).  (28-Jan-2001).














                                        - 22 -



     40.  Improved Feature: Each of the new sequence capture features  provides  a
          Driver  Assistant button, so the amount of requested frame buffer memory
          can be more conveniently changed.  The sequence capture Driver Assistant
          also allows either specifying the number of frame buffers (and shows the
          amount of memory required) or specifying the total amount of memory (and
          shows the number of resulting frame buffers).  (01-Feb-2001).

     41.  Fixed  Feature:  The  Driver  Assistant would accidentally reset the -QU
          parameter  whenever  changing  other  driver  configuration  parameters.
          (16-Feb-2001).

     42.  Improved  Feature:  A  new EPIXXCW2.SYS driver for Windows 2000 provides
          better  compatibility  with  newer  motherboards.   In  particular,   it
          resolves  a  problem  with motherboards using early 800 series chipsets,
          which would not provide interrupts.  When converting to the new  driver,
          it  is  suggested  that  (a) Remove PIXCI(R) imaging boards from the PC,
          (b) Run the Driver Assistant, Uninstall PIXCI(R)  Driver,  (c) Reinstall
          the  PIXCI(R) imaging boards.  The older EPIXXCWT.SYS driver for Windows
          NT may still be used under Windows  2000  on  all  previously  supported
          motherboards.  (20-Feb-2001).

     43.  Modified  Feature:  For multiple PIXCI(R) imaging boards used with indi-
          vidual format and controls: The explicit Save and Load Video  Setup,  as
          well  as the Load and Save implied when the imaging boards are opened or
          closed, now load or save individual video formats (to the  single  file)
          for each imaging board.  (05-Mar-2001)

     44.  Improved  Feature:  The script record/play feature, when used with image
          load, save or other features that uses path and file names,  now  allows
          selecting  whether the file browser, when used during recording, selects
          a fixed file and path name to be inserted during  playback,  or  whether
          the  file  browser  re-appears during playback allowing selection of the
          path and file name.  (20-Mar-2001).

     45.  Improved Feature: The four Sequence Capture  features,  Video  to  Frame
          Buffers  Video to Disk File, Video to Memory Buffers, and Video to Image
          Files now provide, when recording at subvideo rates, a time  stamp  fea-
          ture which records the time at which each image was captured, and either
          overlays the time nondestructively or permanently marks the  image  with
          the time.  (22-Mar-2001).

     46.  Improved  Feature:  A  sequence of images can now be saved to, or loaded
          from, a single file in X/Y Binary format, as well as the previously sup-
          ported  sequence  of  files,  one  per  image,  in  X/Y  Binary  format.
          (23-Mar-2001).

     47.  Fixed Feature: The Driver Assistant, Uninstall PIXCI Imaging Board  fea-
          ture   would   not   always   remove   all   of  the  registry  entries.
          (21-Apr-2001).

     48.  Fixed Feature: The Pixel Pair Arithmetic, Ratio was actually computing a
          Product.  The Pixel Pair Arithmetic, User-Defined did not always operate
          correctly with pixels with more than 8 bits.  (26-Apr-2001).

     49.  Improved feature.  The Draw, Text feature now  allows  drawing  multiple
          lines of text.  (07-May-2001).

     50.  Added  feature:  XCAP  now  supports  the PIXCI(R) CL1 series of imaging
          boards for Camera Link cameras.  (15-May-2001).

     51.  Added  Feature:  XCAP  now  supports  the  PIXCI(R) SV5  imaging  board.
          (29-May-2001).

     52.  Fixed  feature: For PIXCI(R) SV4 and SV5 in color capture mode, clicking
          the BNC or S-Video connector in the sketch of the board's  bracket  only
          changed the input selection, but did not also change the `Y/C Component'
          selection of the video setup.  (12-Jun-2001).

     53.  Added Feature: XCAP-Std now allows opening and operating multiple,  non-
          identical  PIXCI(R)  imaging boards.  There are no restrictions on board
          or camera combinations, such  as  analog  vs.  digital,  monochrome  vs.
          color,  low  resolution  vs. high resolution, low bit depth vs. high bit
          depth, or continuous video mode vs. asynchronous reset mode.   XCAP-Lite
          only   allows  opening  multiple,  identical  PIXCI(R)  imaging  boards.
          (02-Jul-2001).

     54.  Fixed Feature: In certain sequence capture or triggered  capture  modes,
          and  depending on various other factors, intermittent errors of `Unknown
          error: getLiveStatus' may be reported.  (12-Jul-2001).

     55.  Improved Feature: The popup `Abort' button and `% Done' indicator  which
          appears when running long image processing and other operations has been
          replaced with a non-popup bar graph using the existing  `Cancel'  button
          for  premature termination.  The new non-popup style consumes less over-
          head and reduces visual clutter.  Also, the elapsed processing time  can
          now  be reported.  The old popup style, as well as other optional styles
          and the elapsed time report, can be selected from Utility, Program  Set-
          up, Gui.  (03-Aug-2001)

     56.  Fixed Feature: Support for opening and operating multiple, non-identical
          PIXCI(R) imaging boards was not fully included in Windows  NT/2000  ver-
          sions.  (17-Aug-2001)

     57.  Improved  Feature:  The  Examine,  Pixel Peek now allows selecting pixel
          values to be highlighted via a user-defined expression.  (15-Sep-2001).

     58.  Fixed feature: The Video to Image Files did not work properly using TIFF
          format and cameras producing BGR pixels (but did work in other file for-
          mats, or with cameras producing grey or RGB pixels).  (17-Oct-2001).

     59.  Improved Feature:  The  Sequence  Capture  -  Video  to  Frame  Buffers,
          Sequence  Capture  -  Video  to Memory, Sequence Capture - Video to Disk
          File, and Sequence Capture - Video to Image Files, now allow using  mul-
          tiple  events,  with each event controlling capture of each image of the
          sequence.  The previous event feature, with a single  event  controlling
          the start or stop of a free-running sequence capture, is also available.
          (18-Oct-2001).

     60.  Improved Feature: For Bayer output cameras, under White (Balance Correc-
          tions),  the  Extract  Black  Ref(erence) is now functional.  It was not
          needed for previously supported cameras, but may  be  needed  for  newer
          CMOS cameras.  (16-Nov-2001).

     61.  Updated  Feature:  The  Video  to StreamStor has been updated to utilize
          V4.5 of the StreamStor XLRAPI.DLL.  Use with earlier  versions  may  not
          work.  (20-Nov-2001).

     62.  Version 2.2 released, adding support for Windows XP.  (03-Dec-2001).

     63.  Added  Feature:  Under  Utility,  Program  Setup, Gui, the indexing of a
          sequence of image buffers can be altered so that  the  first  buffer  is
          indexed as one rather than zero.  (03-Dec-2001).

     64.  Fixed  Feature: Under Windows XP, the Driver Assistant and forceful mem-
          ory allocation feature would add boot options to boot.ini, but not force
          the options to become visible during Windows' startup.  (12-Dec-2001)

     65.  Improved  Feature: An option for image display via the Video for Windows
          API has been added.  This API may be slightly slower on some  computers,
          but  may  reduce the appearance of `band' artifacts due to the S/VGA and
          PIXCI(R) imaging board being asynchronous.  (21-Jan-2002).

     66.  Improved Feature: Sequence Play features now provide a Pause  button  to
          pause sequence display, and a scroll pot to visually show and adjust the
          current displayed image buffer number.  (22-Jan-2002).

     67.  Improved Feature: For PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5 and  for  PIXCI(R)  D,
          D24,  D32,  D2X,  D3X,  CL1 with selected digital cameras, the Capture &
          Adjust now offers interactive specification of a capture AOI via the new
          Max Capture AOI and Set Capture AOI buttons.  (06-Feb-2002).

     68.  Fixed  Feature:  Recent  releases of XCAP-Lite allowed opening multiple,
          non-identical PIXCI(R) imaging boards, contrary to published  specifica-
          tions.  XCAP-Lite only allows opening multiple, identical PIXCI(R) imag-
          ing boards.  (14-Mar-2002).

     69.  A XCAP-Ltd version is released, with more features than  XCAP-Lite,  but
          fewer than XCAP-Std.  Like XCAP-Std and XCAP-Plus, the XCAP-Ltd requires
          an  authorization  key,  either  on  the  printer  port  or  USB   port.

     70.  Added  Feature: Saving and re-loading images in the FITS (Flexible Image
          Transport System) format has been added.  (01-Apr-2002)

     71.  Improved Feature: For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112C and several other Bayer
          output  cameras  under White (Balance Corrections), a Saturation control
          has been added allowing color `strength' to be adjusted lower or  higher
          than the default.  (05-Apr-2002).

     72.  Improved  Feature: For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112C and other Bayer output
          cameras, the software Bayer conversion algorithms have been improved  to
          be  faster  and/or operate with less overhead.  For the SILICON VIDEO(R)
          2112C, the Scan Direction  feature  is  now  supported  in  color  mode.
          (12-Apr-2002).

     73.  Added Feature: Loading image sequences in the AVI format has been added.
          (22-Apr-2002).

     74.  Improved Feature: For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112C and other Bayer  output
          cameras, an automatic, continuous, white balance feature has been added.
          The automatic white balance is more convenient than  manual  white  bal-
          ance,  but  can be fooled by atypical scenes; the explicit white balance
          feature remains for precision applications.  (13-May-2002).

     75.  New Feature: The `slider  controls'  typically  associated  with  camera
          exposure  and  gain  settings  now  have  a `zoom' feature accessible by
          right-clicking on the control.  (17-May-2002)

     76.  New Feature: The default directory in which images and other  files  are
          saved  and  loaded  can  now  be  changed  in  Utility,  Program  Setup.
          (30-Sep-2002).

     77.  New Feature: The new Histogram Pair feature provides  a  two-dimensional
          graph  of  the  difference  of corresponding pixels of a pair of images.
          (06-Oct-2002)

     78.  Improved Feature: The RGB Merge feature now offers the  option  of  dis-
          playing the composite RGB image in the original image view window, or in
          a separate image view window.  The former minimizes  window  `confusion'
          and `real-estate', the latter allows seeing both the monochrome image as
          captured and the composite image.  Similarly, the Frame Average  feature
          now offers the option of displaying the averaged imagery in the original
          image view window, or in a separate image view window.   Similarly,  the
          Quad  Pixel Merge feature now offers the option of displaying the merged
          imagery in the original image view window, or in a separate  image  view
          window.  (10-Oct-2002).

     79.  Fixed  Feature:  The Sequence Capture: Video to Memory Buffers, Video to
          Disk, and Video to Files now work with the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD  and  Basler
          A504k.   Not that anyone would have missed these features, as they can't
          hope to accommodate the high frame rate and bandwidth being generated by

     80.  Improved  Feature: The Sequence Capture to Frame Buffers, to Memory Buf-
          fers, to Disk File, and to Image Files features now allows selecting the
          event  delay  in seconds, in percent of saved images, or as a pretrigger
          in percent of saved images, as well as the current option  of  selecting
          the event delay in video fields.  (03-Nov-2002).

     81.  Improved Feature: The Image Save and Load Sequence, in TIFF and AVI for-
          mats, now support file sizes up to 4 GiByte  rather  than  the  previous
          2 GiByte limit.  (05-Nov-2002)

     82.  Modified Feature: The default frame buffer memory size under Windows NT,
          2000,  and  XP  has  been  increased   from   4 MiByte   to   16 MiByte.
          (05-Nov-2002).

     83.  Improved Feature: The Measure, Particle Tracking now reports delta H & V
          coordinates, reports vector magnitude and angle, allows reporting to the
          Windows  Clipboard,  and  allows  customization  of  values  to  report.
          (11-Nov-2002).

     84.  Improved Feature: The Measure, Particle Tracking and Measure, Blob Anal-
          ysis  now provide a `Live' option in which the particle or blob analysis
          is automatically performed when the image changes or an analysis parame-
          ter is modified.  (11-Nov-2002)

     85.  Improved  Feature: Most of the features under Modify now provide a `Pre-
          view' option, allowing viewing of the operation's effect without  perma-
          nent changes to the image.  (25-Nov-2002).

     86.  Improved Feature: For cameras with RS-232 or CameraLink serial controls,
          the layout of XCAP's camera controls has been modified to be  easier  to
          use.   The layout of the capture controls in the `Capture & Adjust' dia-
          log has also been improved.  (17-Jan-2003)

     87.  Improved Feature: For cameras with `raw' Bayer output, XCAP's color con-
          trols have been modified to be easier to use.  For many cameras, includ-
          ing the SILICON VIDEO(R) 2112, the color quality has also been improved.
          A  color  calibration  feature now allows automatic setting of the color
          space corrections.  (24-Jan-2003).

     88.  Improved Feature: When using sequence capture to frame  buffers  with  a
          PIXCI(R) D, D24, D32, D2X, CL1, or CL3SD with a camera in free-run mode,
          with triggered event sequence start  or  sequence  stop,  without  using
          delays,  the trigger latency as been reduced from (approx.) 5 msec. to a
          single field/frame.  (31-Jan-2003).

     89.  Fixed Feature: A new version of drivers  for  the  authorization  key(s)
          eliminates   some   compatibility   issues   on   Windows XP   machines.
          (17-Feb-2003).

     90.  Modified Feature: Scripts now have default directory `scripts',  instead
          of  the  previous `data'.  This allows the data directory to be changed,
          and images files (re)organized, without affecting scripts and tool bars.
          (02-Mar-2003).

     91.  Improved  Feature:  When  using  image save sequence and entering a file
          name pattern with many `?'  characters (each representing a  file  index
          digit), XCAP pauses to check whether any possible file matching the pat-
          tern previously exists.  On slower machines, or with many (six or  more)
          `?'   characters,  these  checks  may take a significant amount of time.
          The time required for  these  checks  has  been  significantly  reduced.
          (13-Mar-2003).

     92.  Improved  Feature:  The  default  directory for scripts is now `scripts'
          rather than `data', allowing the default data directory to  be  changed,
          such  as  for  organizing  groups  of  images, without also changing the
          default directory for scripts.  (10-Mar-2003)

     93.  Added Feature: The shortcuts provided with the PIXCI(R) image viewer can
          now   be  customized  or  replaced  by  using  Utility,  Program  Setup,
          Start/End, PIXCI(R).  (18-Mar-2003)

     94.  Improved Feature: For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 1310 camera, the  frame  rate
          can  now  be  increased by using subsampling and/or using a smaller AOI.
          Previously,  only  a  smaller  AOI  would  increase  the   frame   rate.
          (11-Apr-2003)

     95.  Modified  Feature:  The  `Open  PIXCI(R) on Startup (of XCAP)' option is
          now, by default, enabled, making XCAP more convenient for novice user's.
          (15-Apr-2003)

     96.  Improved  Feature:  The  various  graphic  tools  now have a `Mark Image
          Sequence' feature, to mark each image of the sequence,  in  addition  to
          the  previous  `Mark  Image' feature which marks only the current image.
          (12-May-2003)

     97.  Fixed Feature: The Video to Image files, when used with multiple  boards
          and common controls, would not force the filename pattern to have suffi-
          cient `?'  characters with which to support indexing number  of  desired
          images multiplied by the number of boards.  The problem occurs only when
          the Number of Images is increased explicitly, and the file name  pattern
          modified  implicitly.   It  does  not occur if the appropriate file name
          pattern is entered explicitly.  (16-Jun-2003).

     98.  Improved Feature: For CameraLink cameras with serial controls, the  Cap-
          ture  &  Adjust  now defaults to the serial communication being enabled,
          rather than disabled (as was, and remain, the default for  cameras  with
          RS-232 controls).  24-Jun-2003.

     99.  Fixed  Feature:  For  the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD,  under Windows 2000, XP, the
          improved driver installation file, epixxcw2.inf, set

                   PIXCI= ... -WT -0x20

          to activate high resolution  timestamps.   The  superfluous  `-'  causes
          software  to believe the board has 4 GiByte of memory, regardless of the
          amount of memory actually installed.  Post installation, the problem can
          be remedied by using PIXCI(R) Open/Close Advanced to change any registry
          setting.  (27-Jun-2003).

    100.  Improved Feature: The Sequence Capture, Video to Image Files  now  allow
          the  captured  sequence to be modified, such as with image processing or
          graphic  overlays.   Previous,  any  such  modifications  were  silently
          ignored   and   the   original   captured   images  remained  unchanged.
          (07-Jul-2003).

    101.  Improved Feature: Actions initiated by shortcuts are  now  recorded  and
          replayed  from  a script.  Previously, the alternate menu item or button
          with identical effect had to be used in  order  for  the  action  to  be
          recorded  and  replayed.   Also,  shortcuts  can now be connected to the
          Black Board, similar to buttons' connections.  (14-Jul-2003).

    102.  Fixed Documentation: The documentation for Capture - GIO  Event  Capture
          describes  `High  Priority,  Not Abortable' `Normal Priority, Abortable'
          `Wait Timeout, sec.'  option which haven't been used since V1.5.   Event
          capture  is now always high priority, but with none of the previous dis-
          advantages.  (30-Jul-2003).

    103.  Improved Feature: The Capture - GIO Event Capture now offers  an  option
          to  select  rising  edge  versus  falling  edge  triggering,  except for
          PIXCI(R) D, D24, and D32 imaging boards.  (30-Jul-2003).

    104.  Improved Feature: The PIXCI(R)  SV5A  is  now  supported  distinct  from
          PIXCI(R)  SV5;  the  default  SV5A  video  setup  is NTSC, not the SV5's
          NTSC/YC.  (02-Oct-2003).

    105.  Improved Feature: XCAP now provides improved support for navigating  the
          GUI  using  the  keyboard's TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys to shift input focus,
          and ENTER and other keys to effect selections.  (24-Oct-2003).

    106.  Fixed Feature: Using the `High Resolution Time Stamp' option on  certain
          motherboards resulted in time stamps flowing backwards, albeit with high
          resolution.  (31-Oct-2003).

    107.  Added Feature: The new Sequence Pair Arithmetic and Sequence  Pair  Nor-
          malization  features  allow applying image pair arithmetic or normaliza-
          tions on each image of a sequence.  (18-Nov-2003).














                                        - 29 -



    108.  Modified Feature: When using the default image  display  mode,  DirectX,
          the  mouse cursor may blink over the image view window when the graphics
          display (S/VGA) does not include hardware support for the cursor.   XCAP
          now  detects  whether the graphics display provides hardware cursor sup-
          port and if not uses an alternate display method.  (25-Nov-2003).

    109.  Fixed Feature: An `out of memory' error may occur when opening  multiple
          image   view  windows,  or  opening  and  closing  image  view  windows.
          (10-Feb-2004).

    110.  Added Feature: The Save Image now allows saving an image directly  to  a
          FTP URL.  (15-Feb-2004).

    111.  Improved  Feature:  The Save Image, Save Image Sequence, and Print Image
          now allow automatic inclusion  of  any  overlay  graphics.   (Previously
          Duplicate  Image  had  to  be used to create a copy `As Shown', and that
          copy saved or printed).  (19-Feb-2004).

    112.  Fixed Feature: When using Video to Frame Buffers with  a  PIXCI(R)  SV4,
          SV5,  or  SV5A, with Event Start, one, two, or three extra frames may be
          captured at the end of the  sequence,  overwriting  the  first,  second,
          and/or  third frame buffers.  Further, if the Set AOI to Capture Buffers
          option is set, the AOI may be set incorrectly.  (The  second  aspect  of
          the  problem  can be manually corrected by explicitly resetting the AOI,
          but there is no work-around for the first aspect).  (28-Apr-2004).

    113.  Modified Feature: The default extension for video  to  disk  files  have
          been  changed  to .vif from .bin, to avoid confusion with other types of
          .bin files.  As before, the extension is only suggested; the feature can
          still be used with .bin files.  (18-May-2004).

    114.  Modified  Feature: The `Print, Windows' and `Print, PXIPL' features have
          been simplified and integrated into a single easier to use `Print Image'
          feature.   Also,  the `Print Image' now allows formatting an image as an
          encapsulated PostScript file.  (31-May-2004).

    115.  Fixed Feature: Various frequency and time measurements may be inaccurate
          when  capturing video in conjunction with certain PCI chipsets.  See MKB
          Article #274323.  These errors affected the informational displays, such
          as  `frames  per  second'  but  did not affect image or sequence capture
          which is governed by the camera's timing.  (08-Jun-2004)

    116.  Improved Feature: Particle tracking now allows tracking particles param-
          eters allow tracking particles which may disappear before the end of the
          sequence,  or  appear  after  the  start  of  the  sequence,  or   both.
          (16-Aug-2004)

    117.  Added  Feature:  When used with color cameras that output raw Bayer val-
          ues, the Pixel Peek, Pixel Plot, Pixel Plot 3D  and  Histogram  features
          allow  viewing  and analyzing `raw' Bayer values while the image display












                                        - 30 -



          continues to show color.  (Previously, one had to set software to assume
          a monochrome camera, but the displayed image was also monochrome).

             Further,  the  Pixel Plot, Pixel Plot 3D and Histogram features allow
          selecting  viewing  or  analysis  of  only  the  red,  the   blue,   the
          green(blue),  or  the  green(red)  values.  This allows easy analysis of
          uniformity, without the confusion caused  by  different  colored  pixels
          having different sensitivities.

             When  viewing  or analyzing a single bayer color, software duplicates
          each r, g(b), g(r), or b value three times throughout each  2x2  mosaic.
          Thus  a  histogram  of  a  10x10  AOI  will  always contain 100 samples,
          although 3/4 of them are duplicates.  Similarly a pixel plot  of  row  N
          and  N+1 always has the same number of samples, even though there are no
          red values, or no blue values, on one of the two lines.   This  replica-
          tion  of  pixel  values throughout the 2x2 mosaic has no relationship to
          the Bayer-to-RGB interpolation used to create color  images;  it  is  an
          artifice for convenient numerical analysis.  (18-Nov-2004)

    118.  Improved  Feature: XCAP now recognizes and supports Windows Server 2003.
          (29-Nov-2004)

    119.  Corrected Documentation: On the PIXCI(R) D2X, D3X, CL1, CL3SD,  and  SI,
          the  PIXCI(R)  Connections  description of the pins used for the IN1 and
          IN2 TTL G.P. Input signals has been changed, swapping IN1 for IN2 so  as
          to be consistent with their usage in existing software.  (28-Dec-2004).

    120.  Improved  Feature:  Images  saved  in  TIFF format can now be compressed
          using LZW compression.  (30-Jan-2005).

    121.  Fixed feature: For the SILICON VIDEO(R) 9M001, when using small areas of
          interest,  the frame rate specified in the GUI was inconsistent with the
          actual frame rate.  The camera's frame rate increases as the  AOI  width
          is  decreased, but only until the AOI is (approx.) 548 pixels wide; nar-
          rower AOI's have little or no effect on the frame rate.  (01-Feb-2005).

    122.  Added feature: The Video to Image Files now allows copying of each  cap-
          tured  image  to  a  FTP URL, providing an easy to use `Video to Web' or
          `WebCam' feature.  (23-Mar-2005).

    123.  Improved Feature: The TIFF PackBits Lossless compression option now sup-
          ports  color  images,  and  pixel components with more than 8 bits.  The
          TIFF EPIX(R) Lossless compression option (formerly Grey-Level  Lossless)
          now   supports  color  images  and  pixel  components  up  to  12  bits.
          (31-Mar-2005).

    124.  Added Feature: Sequence Capture now  allows  selecting  an  Image  Delta
          event,  triggered  when the live image stream has changed significantly.
          Like many other possible event strategies, an Image Delta  event  previ-
          ously  was  available by means of the Black Board and Modify operations;












                                        - 31 -



          inclusion of an explicit Image Delta  event  adds  greater  convenience.
          (19-Apr-2005).

    125.  Added  Feature: For Bayer-output color cameras, XCAP now offers an image
          sharpening option to the video stream processing.  (15-Jun-2005).

    126.  Improved Feature: The performance of Sequence Capture - Video  to  Disk,
          Video  to  Image  Files,  and  Video  to  Virtual  Memory  have all been
          improved.  The Video to Disk feature now includes an option to  override
          the  disk's reported sector (i.e. alignment) size, which is often needed
          for RAID systems where the optimal sector size  is  different  than  the
          size  reported  to  and through Windows.  The Video to Disk feature also
          includes an option to specify the disk I/O size (normally equal  to  one
          frame  buffer),  so  that several small frame buffers can be accumulated
          before I/O.  (25-Sep-2005).

    127.  Added Feature: XCAP for Linux now supports 2.6 kernels,  and  also  sup-
          ports  cut/paste  operations.  XCAP for Linux now has `autoload' options
          for the authorization key driver and  for  the  PIXCI(R)  imaging  board
          driver, so that when XCAP is re-run after a reboot of Linux, these driv-
          ers will be automatically loaded.  (07-Oct-2005)

    128.  New Feature: XCAP for Linux now supports 2.6 kernels.  (11-Oct-2005).

    129.  Improved Feature: XCAP now supports the AVI 2.0  file  format,  allowing
          files larger than 4 GiByte, subject to support by the underlying operat-
          ing system.  (30-Dec-2005).

    130.  Improved Feature: XCAP for Linux now includes  a  driver  re-compilation
          kits  for  the  PIXCI(R)  imaging  board  and for the authorization key.
          These allow supporting a wider variety of 2.4 and 2.6 kernels  than  are
          supported by the distributed, pre-compiled drivers.  (22-Feb-2006).

    131.  Fixed  Feature:  The  Script  Play  did not allow mismatch of alphabetic
          upper  vs.  lower  case  between  the  script   and   XCAP's   features.
          (03-Mar-2006)

    132.  Improved  Feature:  For  Video  to Disk: (a) XCAP will no longer use the
          last frame buffer to render the current Video to Disk  image;  there  is
          one  extra  frame buffer for queuing video, and there is confusion as to
          what the PIXCI Image Viewer represents.  (b) When creating  a  video  to
          disk  file,  say  xx.vif,  XCAP  will  also  create a xx.fmt and xx.ini.
          (c) The MainWindow, File, Load New Image Sequence, will now allow  load-
          ing  and  displaying   of the video to disk sequence iff all three files
          (.vif, .fmt, .ini) are present.  This eliminates users  forgetting  what
          resolution  their  PIXCI  card  was set to when trying to display an old
          file via the Video to Disk feature, and is more user friendly,  so  that
          video  to  disk  files  can  be loaded from the same dialog used to load
          .avi, .tif, etc.  into a new image viewer.  Finally, this  feature  will
          be  available  even  when a PIXCI card is not present, but only in XCAP-

    133.  Added feature: XCAP now supports the PIXCI(R) E1, E1DB,  E4,  E4DB,  EL1
          series of imaging boards for Camera Link cameras.  (07-Jul-2006)

    134.  Improved  Feature:  For  Video to Disk: the image capture date & time is
          now optionally saved in the video to disk file.  Formerly,  the  capture
          date  &  time was only saved in memory, expecting that immediately after
          recording the raw video to disk file along with the image  date  &  time
          would  be  re-saved  as  TIFF or another standard format.  Recording the
          date & time in the raw video to disk file allows delaying  the  resaving
          of the video to disk file, and avoids common user errors.  (11-Aug-2006)

    135.  Added  feature:  XCAP  now has preliminary support for the PIXCI(R) EC1;
          Express Card imaging boards; the number of general purpose inputs,  out-
          puts, and triggers is not yet finalized.  (18-Dec-2006)

    136.  Fixed Feature: When only one frame buffer is available, XCAP incorrectly
          forced use of Live Mode: Snap, Display, Snap, slowing the display  rate;
          and  once  set, that choice persisted after more buffers are made avail-
          able, until explicitly changed.  (04-Jan-2007)

    137.  Improved Feature: Drivers for Windows 2000 and XP, as well  all  Windows
          DLL's and executables, are now digitally signed.  (17-Jan-2007)

    138.  Added  feature:  XCAP  now supports the PIXCI(R) EL1DB series of imaging
          boards for Camera Link cameras.  (23-Jan-2007)

    RELEASE NOTES: XCAP  -- Version 1.0 and Subreleases

      1.  Version 1.0 released.  (24-Mar-1999).

      2.  Not in printed manual: The size of icons shown in the  `Scripts  -  Load
          Tool Bar' can also be specified.  See on-line documentation.

      3.  Added  feature:  A Distance & Angle Crosshairs provides spatial calibra-
          tion and measurement of absolute position, relative position, length and
          angles.   While these capabilities are also available elsewhere in Image
          Viewer -  Measure  and  Image  Viewer  -  Draw,  the  Distance  &  Angle
          Crosshairs  collects chosen features to provide a single dialog with the
          equivalent of a so-called `Video Crosshair Overlay &  Measurement'  sys-
          tem.

      4.  Modified  feature: The XY=>HV Mapping: Scaled (Aspect Ratio 1:1) mode of
          Spatial Calibration has been modified to  allow  using  a  single  known
          length,  in combination with any image aspect ratio, to provide scaled X
          and Y mapping for XY to HV units.  The names of  all  three  modes  have
          been modified, to better reflect their function.














                                        - 33 -



      5.  Added  features: Many of the `Modify' windows, that performed image pro-
          cessing on a single image buffer, now have counterparts that perform the
          same  processing  on  each  buffer  through  a sequence.  As a matter of
          style, these operations are named `Sequence ...'; while operations which
          combine  data  from  across  multiple images in a sequence are now named
          `... Sequence .'

      6.  Modified feature: Camera RS-232 control now provides COM  search,  which
          can be used instead of explicitly specifying a COM port.

      7.  Modified  feature: The Threshold, Dynamic is renamed to Threshold, Adap-
          tive.

      8.  New feature: An image sequence can be saved in Windows AVI format.

      9.  New feature: Histogram equalization (under Contrast Enhancement) can now
          specify  a  user-defined  curve,  in addition to the previous predefined
          selections.

     10.  Fixed feature: Particle tracking did not allow use of an AOI.

     11.  Fixed feature: The correlation finder did not allow use of AOI  combined
          with searching for for more than one match.

     12.  Added  features:  Two  alternate  particle tracking methods.  Both track
          particles using as few as two captured frames.

     13.  Added feature: An image, or live video, can be displayed  `Full  Screen'
          with little or no `window frame'.

     14.  Added  feature:  The `Radial Mass Plot' displays a two-dimensional graph
          of the sum of pixel values versus the pixels' distance from an origin.

     15.  Modified feature: The Histogram and Correlation finder have  been  modi-
          fied so that in their Live mode, the selected AOI is changed to the cur-
          rent image buffer.

     16.  Fixed feature: The Particle Tracking did not operate properly when using
          an area of interest smaller than the full image.

     17.  Fixed  feature: The Video to Disk, when aborted in the middle of capture
          or display, may cause XCAP to die.

     18.  Added feature: The Modify, Noise Generator provides  several  new  noise
          distributions.   The  Dither  operations, previously in Arithmetic, have
          been moved.

     19.  Added feature: Under Palette, the new Bit Transposition paradigm  allows
          viewing an image with the ordering of each pixel's bits changed.













                                        - 34 -



     20.  Fixed  feature:  The  View, Pixel Peek, Save Data feature would save the
          first line of the image AOI repeatedly, for as  many  lines  as  in  the
          image AOI.

     21.  Added  feature:  Under Modify, Pair Normalization, the Spot Mask Correc-
          tion is intended to remove `spots' caused by imperfect sensors; i.e. bad
          pixels which consistently occur in the same location.

     22.  Added feature: The View, Display, Window allows setting the image viewer
          window's default size, such as to be full screen.  (02-Aug-1999).

     23.  Modified feature: The default API for  image  display  is  now  DirectX.
          Should a particular S/VGA card cause death when DirectX is accessed, the
          allowable image display API(s) can be modified in Utility, Program  Set-
          up, API's before an image view window is opened and the image displayed.
          (02-Aug-1999).

     24.  Added feature: A `Path Enclosed Region' and a  `Path  Curve'  have  been
          added  as  graphic shapes.  The `Path Enclosed Region' is also available
          for use as a region.  (09-Aug-1999).

     25.  Fixed feature: Using `Load Image' (rather than `Load Image Sequence') on
          a  TIFF  file  containing a sequence does not allow a single image to be
          loaded.  (09-Aug-1999).

     26.  Added feature: A Clock type cell has been  added  to  the  Black  Board.
          (13-Aug-1999).

     27.  Fixed  feature: Versions of Print, Windows with the added `Force Dialog'
          option did not allow changing the printed size.  (13-Aug-1999).

     28.  Improved feature: The dialog created by file name `Browse' buttons  does
          not, while active, freeze the screen.  (20-Aug-1999).

     29.  Fixed  feature: The Subpixel Edger, when used w/out Spatial Calibration,
          produces errors.  (24-Aug-1999).

     30.  Fixed feature: The 2-D Graph's Probe and Stat  Window  features  do  not
          work  properly  in  conjunction with MinMax (i.e. zoom).  Similarly, the
          File,  Save  feature  would  only  save  the  data  shown  via   MinMax.
          (29-Aug-1999).

     31.  Added  feature:  An  image  can  be directly e-mail'ed from within XCAP.
          Combined with the Black Board, these features can also be used  to  cap-
          ture and e-mail an image periodically.  (30-Aug-1999).

     32.  Fixed feature: The Modify, Sequence Average did not work with frame buf-
          fers used with certain multi-tap cameras.  (21-Sep-1999).














                                        - 35 -



     33.  Fixed feature: The Load New Image, Multimedia, JPEG format did not  work
          with monochrome (8 bit per pixel) JPEG files.  (24-Sep-1999).

     34.  Added  feature:  An  image,  or  image  sequence, can be now be saved in
          JPEG/JFIF  format,  with  selectable  quality  (and  thus  compression).
          JPEG/JFIF  images  can also be loaded.  Currently, only 8 bits per pixel
          component is supported.  (27-Sep-1999).

     35.  Added feature: The predefined shortcuts for first buffer,  next  buffer,
          previous  buffer,  last  buffer,  snap, live, and unlive may now be also
          activated with key clicks of HOME, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, END, S,  U,   and
          L, respectively.  (27-Sep-1999).

     36.  Added  feature: The user-defined tool bars may now also specify for each
          shortcut, a key, which when pressed, activates the same script as click-
          ing the icon.  This feature specifies keys, not characters; thus scripts
          can be initiated by the large space bar or enter key.  (27-Sep-1999).

     37.  Fixed feature: The Mass & Moments, Raw Moments option  did  not  display
          the  Raw  Moments,  but was ignored and continued to display the current
          moments.  Using the Center of Mass mode after the Moments mode  did  not
          zero-out  the  various  moments  which  Center of Mass does not compute.
          (04-Oct-1999).

     38.  Added feature: Palettes can now be imported  and  exported,  using  TIFF
          format  to represent the palette values.  Palettes can also be saved and
          loaded in an internal format, which, when loaded, resets  the  palette's
          parameters and paradigm.  (In contrast, an imported palette can only set
          the current palette values, but not the parameters from which  the  pal-
          ette was constructed).  (04-Oct-1999).

     39.  Added  feature:  The PIXCI(R) Camera Info provides a list of cameras and
          video formats supported by  and various  PIXCI(R)  imaging  boards.   It
          also  allows  viewing  a  non-operational Capture - Adjust dialog, which
          provides integrated control of both imaging board and any supported cam-
          era.  (11-Oct-1999).

     40.  Fixed  feature:  The  recently  added JPEG support did not work properly
          with pixel components other than 8 bits, or for images of certain dimen-
          sions.  (14-Oct-1999).

     41.  Added  feature:  A  new  graphic  shape, Parallel Lines, has been added.
          (25-Oct-1999)

     42.  Improved feature: The Subpixel Edger now directly shows, without  having
          to  use  the  Black  Board, the relative distance from edge 1 to edge 2,
          from edge 1 to edge 3, and from the midpoint of edges 1&2  to  the  mid-
          point  of edges 3&4, and the angles of each relative to the origin.  The
          Subpixel Edger now distinguishes the ticks drawn at each edge, the long-
          est  is edge 1, the next longest is edge 2, etc.  Using the new Parallel












                                        - 36 -



          Lines shape, the Subpixel Edger can either, a) Find one edge on each  of
          4 parallel lines, or b) Average the pixel data under the parallel lines,
          and find up to 4 edges on the result.  (25-Oct-1999).

     43.  Fixed feature: An executed script would not set the `index'  and  `thru'
          fields of a file sequence specification, but only set the file name pat-
          tern.  (25-Oct-1999).

     44.  Improved feature: The various graphical tools, in  interactive  move  or
          rotate mode, now move or rotate relative to the mouse's initial position
          to the graphic.  (e.g., in move mode, the graphic doesn't  jump  so  the
          origin is under the mouse, but retains the same distance relative to the
          mouse).  In addition to being easier to use with a single  graphic,  the
          feature allows several graphics to be moved as a group.  (26-Oct-1999).

     45.  Fixed  feature:  The XCAP TWAIN Sourcery feature would not operate prop-
          erly if XCAP was installed in the root directory.  The fix also includes
          a  modified  TWAIN  Sourcery driver (TWPXXCAP.DS) which is provided with
          the TWAIN package, not with XCAP.  (03-Nov-1999).

     46.  Fixed feature: The Modify,  Sequence  Noise  Generator,  would  have  no
          effect  on  certain  image  types,  although the Modify, Noise Generator
          would operate correctly.  (14-Nov-1999)

     47.  Improved feature: The Measure, Intensity Calibration and  Measure,  Spa-
          tial  Calibration  now  allow  their  settings to be saved and reloaded.
          (14-Nov-1999)

     48.  Improved feature: The File, Save Image and File, Save Image Sequence now
          sets  the  default  file format according to the suffix of the file name
          entered, but still allows overriding the set default and using privately
          defined suffixes.  (15-Nov-1999).

     49.  Added  feature:  The  Capture, RGB Merge allows interpreting and viewing
          three monochromatic frame buffers as a single color  (e.g.  RGB)  image,
          with adjustments for registration and coloring.  (17-Nov-1999)

     50.  Improved  feature: The Graphic Rectangle, Window, Ellipse, Circle, Annu-
          lus, Frame, and Polygon now provide a `Negative' option which draws,  or
          includes  for analysis, the entire image except for the area enclosed by
          the graphical region, rather than the area  enclosed  by  the  graphical
          region.  (22-Nov-1999).

     51.  Fixed  feature:  With a PIXCI(R) D/D24/D32 and some cameras in triggered
          mode (i.e. single shot), the displayed image  is  intentionally  updated
          only  once, but the update might be before the image was completely cap-
          tured.  The effect might be that each snap shows the previously  snapped
          image.  (22-Nov-1999).














                                        - 37 -



     52.  Added  feature: For all 2-D graphs, the new Stats, Outlier feature shows
          descriptive statistics about selected data points being graphed,  namely
          those  data points which are above the corresponding data points in Ref-
          erence B, or which are below the corresponding values  in  Reference  A.
          As  Reference A and Reference B are user-defined curves, arbitrary lower
          and upper bounds can be specified to limit or control which data  points
          are  to be included or excluded, and thereby define application specific
          regions of valid or invalid pixel values.  (29-Nov-1999)

     53.  Added feature: The Modify  features  now  allow  specifying  a  distinct
          source and destination image, rather than assuming that the operation is
          to be applied `in-place'.  Or, for operations  which  operate  upon  two
          images  and  yield a third, the Modify features now allow specifying two
          source images and a distinct destination image.

             In addition, a Live option allows applying  the  operation  automati-
          cally  whenever  the  source image changes.  This allows displaying live
          video which has been processed with contrast enhancement, normalization,
          background subtraction, or other chosen operations.  (06-Dec-1999).

     54.  Added feature: XCAP may be started with a smaller `footprint' by select-
          ing PIXCI(R) Viewer is Main Window and Open PIXCI(R)  on  Startup  under
          Utility, Program Setup.  The Main Window is not shown, only the PIXCI(R)
          Viewer Window.  Features normally accessible from the Main Window,  such
          as Scripts, BlackBoard, creating new image buffers are not available.

             Also under Utility, Program Setup, the PIXCI(R) Shortcuts on Open and
          PIXCI(R) Adjustments on Open allows disabling the  automatic  appearance
          of  Shortcuts  and  Capture  &  Adjust  features along with the PIXCI(R)
          Viewer Window.  These features can still  be  explicitly  accessed  from
          under Capture.

             Under View, Display, Window, the Shortcuts: Attached and Adjustments:
          Attached options allow attaching the Shortcuts or the Capture  &  Adjust
          settings  to  the  image  view window, rather than appearing as distinct
          windows.  Attached Shortcuts and detached Capture & Adjust are  now  the
          default.  (13-Dec-1999).

             Fixed  feature:  The  Driver Assistant's feature to Uninstall Drivers
          did not remove any entries from the Windows Registry.  Under Print, Win-
          dows  the  Force  Aspect feature did not force the correct aspect ratio.
          (15-Dec-1999).

     55.  Improved feature: A Printer Setup button has been added  to  the  Screen
          Capture feature for use with the Graphics to Print mode.  (15-Dec-1999).

     56.  Improved feature: The Graphic Manager and ROI Manager now allows export-
          ing the morphology of regions in a file format compatible with the PXIPL
          Image Processing Library and other applications.  (22-Dec-1999).













                                        - 38 -



     57.  Improved  feature: The Modify, Convolution now allows neighborhood sizes
          as large as 49x49.  Coefficients can now be set by means of a user spec-
          ified  expression,  such as `ifel(abs(x)<=1 || abs(y)<=1, -1: 1)' to set
          the center 3x3 coefficients to -1 and all others to 1.  (28-Dec-1999).

     58.  Fixed feature: Some versions released after 23 Dec 1999  have  debugging
          code,  which,  when  selected  features  are  enabled, may cause XCAP to
          appear `hung-up'.  This cause can be  verified  by  a  "Debugmesg"  item
          appearing in the task-bar.  (10-Jan-2000).

     59.  Improved feature.  Blob analysis now allows setting constraints limiting
          which blobs should be listed, allows  specifying  a  sorting  order  for
          listed  blobs,  allows  specifying  which  columns  of statistics should
          appear in the list and their order, allows specifying the  headings  for
          the  columns  of  statistics, and allows adding user-defined descriptive
          statistics to each listed blob.  The blob statistics can now  be  copied
          to the Windows Clipboard.  (20-Jan-2000).

     60.  Improved  feature.   The  image segmentation used with blob analysis and
          particle tracking now allows modifying the mask image, after  threshold-
          ing,  with  erosion,  dilation, or median filters; providing cleaning of
          noise,  removal  of  protrusions  and  separation  of  touching   blobs.
          (23-Jan-2000).

     61.  Fixed  feature: The Sequence Capture with mouse click event, would trig-
          ger when the mouse was passed over the trigger icon, instead of when the
          trigger icon was clicked.  (28-Feb-2000).

     62.  Fixed feature: Only if using the PIXCI(R) Viewer is Main Window feature,
          the 2nd+ time that the Viewer's Palette is requested, the Palette window
          would be missing the menubar and graphical displays.  (02-Mar-2000).

     63.  Modified feature: XCAP no longer requires re-entering of the software ID
          when a different user logs into a computer  where  XCAP  was  previously
          installed.   XCAP  can  still,  optionally, provide multiple user's with
          distinct last used settings.  (02-May-2000).
