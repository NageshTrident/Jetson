    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================





                              1.  Software Installation





       XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, XCAP-Ltd, and XCAP-Lite are easy to install by follow-
    ing the instructions below.


    1.A  For Windows 8/10/11/ 32/64-Bit

       Administrator  privileges  are required to complete the installation proce-
    dure.

      1.  Install Files:

            a.  If XCAP is provided on a CD or DVD:

                  i.  If your computer is set to allow automatic  execution  of  a
                      loaded  CD/DVD,  the CD/DVD's interactive index program will
                      be executed automatically.   Otherwise,  execute  the  index
                      program,  from  a Command Prompt (i.e. Windows Terminal), or
                      via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                               > Z:SETUP       (replace Z with drive letter for your CD/DVD)

                 ii.  Select `Setup PIXCI(R) Imaging Software' and  `XCAP  Imaging
                      Application  for  Windows  10/8/7/Vista/XP/2000  32-Bit'  or
                      `XCAP Imaging  Application  for  Windows  11/10/8/7/Vista/XP
                      64-Bit'.  Click `OK'.

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory   is   nominally   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP,  or
                      C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP for installation  of  32-bit
                      XCAP  on 64-bit Windows, but depends on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN32.EXE (for 32-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      or














    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN64.EXE (for 64-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      from the EPIX, Inc. ftp site.

                 ii.  Execute the downloaded program, from a Command Prompt  (i.e.
                      Windows Terminal), or via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                           > XCAPWIN32.EXE     (for 32-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      or

                           > XCAPWIN64.EXE     (for 64-bit XCAP for Windows)

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory   is   nominally   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP,  or
                      C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP for installation  of  32-bit
                      XCAP  on 64-bit Windows, but depends on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

                 iv.  The downloaded .EXE file may be deleted.

            c.  The installation procedure creates a new program group, containing
                XCAP  and  several  .TXT  files.   The  *.TXT  files contain these
                installation instructions, a list of  distributed  files,  correc-
                tions  or  additions  to this manual, or other up-to-date informa-
                tion.  The PCITIPS.TXT file provides the PCI  Configuration  Tips,
                with  tips  for  resolving  hardware  and software conflicts.  The
                installation procedure also, optionally, creates a desktop  short-
                cut for XCAP.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with an USB autho-
                rization key.  XCAP-Lite is provided with a software Activation ID
                Code.

                   The Blue (older) or Green (newer) authorization USB key has the
                size and shape of a USB thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm) with a stan-
                dard  USB-A  4-pin connector.  If provided, connect the authoriza-
                tion key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached,  to  the  USB  port
                while  XCAP  is  running.  If the authorization key is missing, or
                disconnected while XCAP is running, then  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std  or
                XCAP-Ltd,  will  behave similar to the XCAP-Lite version; selected
                image processing and analysis tools will not be operational.

            b.  Upon first use, XCAP will prompt  for  configuration  as  per  the
                authorization  key  (including  installation  of  drivers), or the
                software Activation ID Code.












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   Subsequently, use Change Setup under Utilities - Program  Setup
                within  XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The PIXCI(R) frame grabber's driver may be installed  in  response
                to the Windows Device Manager's prompts (it will prompt once after
                detecting a newly installed card) and pointing the Device  Manager
                to Drivers\Win8 or Drivers\Win10 for Windows 8/10 32-Bit, or Driv-
                ers\Win8x64,  Drivers\Win10x64,  or  Drivers\Win11x64   for   Win-
                dows 8/10/11 64-Bit  within the chosen installation directory.  Or
                may be installed during XCAP's installation (such as via the XCAP-
                WIN32.EXE or XCAPWIN64.EXE installer).  Or may be installed by the
                PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant feature within XCAP.

                   Alternately,  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  can   be
                installed as follows.

            b.  Open  the  Windows  Device  Manager by right-clicking on the lower
                left corner of the screen and select  `Device  Manager'.   In  the
                Device  Manager  look  for an entry with a yellow exclamation mark
                that is labeled `PCI Device' or `Multimedia Controller' or `Copro-
                cessor'  or  `Unknown Device'.  Double-click on the entry and then
                click the `Update Driver...'  button.  In the `Update Driver Soft-
                ware'  window  that pops-up, select `Browse my computer for driver
                software'; in the `Search for driver software  in  this  location'
                enter  path Drivers\Win8 or Drivers\Win10 for Windows 8/10 32-Bit,
                or Drivers\Win8x64, Drivers\Win10x64, or Drivers\Win11x64 for Win-
                dows 8/10 64-Bit  and  11 64-Bit,  within  the chosen installation
                directory  (typically  C:\XCAP  or  C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP  or
                C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP),  and  click  `Next'.   A  window
                reports `Windows has successfully updated your  driver  software.'
                click `Close' and restart Windows.

            c.  Alternately,   using   the   Windows   Explorer,   highlight  file
                EPIXXCW2.INF  within  Drivers\Win8  or  Drivers\Win10   for   Win-
                dows 8/10 32-Bit,  or  highlight  file  EPIXXCW6.INF  within Driv-
                ers\Win8x64,  Drivers\Win10x64,  or  Drivers\Win11x64   for   Win-
                dows 8/10 64-Bit  and  11 64-Bit,  within  the chosen installation
                directory, right-click and select `Install', and restart Windows.

      4.  Restart Windows.  (Note that using Windows' Shutdown instead of  Restart
          may  delay Windows' recognition of these changes until the second subse-
          quent shutdown!)

      5.  XCAP is now ready to run, by  clicking  the  optional  shortcut,  or  by
          clicking `Start', `Programs', `XCAP Imaging', and finally `XCAP for Win-
          dows'.














    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    1.B  Windows 8/10/11 32/64-Bit Esoterica



    1.B.1  Windows 8/10/11 32/64-Bit - Frame Grabber Driver Installation Details

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber's driver consists of files:

             EPIXXCW2.INF
             EPIXXCW2.CAT
             EPIXXCW2.SYS

    for Windows 8/10 32-Bit, or files:

             EPIXXCW6.INF
             EPIXXCW6.CAT
             EPIXXCW6.SYS

    for Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit.  Driver files for different versions  of  Windows,
    although  with  the  same  file name, may have different digital signatures as
    required by each version of Windows.

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber driver is installed by the Windows  Device  Man-
    ager, or by PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant within XCAP.

       Installation copies the driver files and creates registry entry:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

    for Windows 8/10 32-Bit, or

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

    for  Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit.  Most values within the registry entry are set by
    the Device Manager and should not be modified.  The value:

             PIXCI   =  -IM <memorysize>  ...

    may be created upon installation, added or modified by XCAP, or can  be  added
    or  modified  manually (i.e. via the Registry Editor (REGEDIT)); its component
    value(s) are Driver Configuration Parameters, as described below.


    1.B.2  Windows 8/10/11 32/64-Bit - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       Under Windows 8/10 32/64-Bit and 11 64-Bit, frame  buffer  memory  must  be
    allocated during Windows' initialization.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of frame buffer memory allocation.   The  following  information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The requested frame buffer memory size must be specified  in  the  Registry
    entry described above, using an entry named `PIXCI', such as:

             PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing  the  `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.  If no
    frame buffer memory size is specified, a  default  size  of  32768 KiBytes  is
    used.   Windows  must  be  restarted for the new specification to take effect.
    Note that using Windows' Shutdown instead of Restart may delay Windows' recog-
    nition of these changes until the second subsequent shutdown!

       Optionally,

             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is  to  be  allocated  in blocks or partitions of the stated size.  Requesting
    memory partitioned into blocks may allow receiving more memory that  would  be
    available  as  a  single  block.   However, (a) Each frame buffer must be com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems, the maximum number of partitions is 256
    under 64 bit operating systems.  Systems with  very  high  resolution  cameras
    using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully, so as to
    minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller than a frame  buffer,  at  the
    end of each partition.

       For  the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board frame buffer memory,
    memory reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer  (approximately
    1  MiByte)  and  optionally for support of time stamping of captured frames as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of  frame  buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are needed for
    each frame buffer's capture status.

       Windows 8/10 32/64-Bit and 11 64-Bit limits the maximum amount of  allocat-
    able frame buffer memory, dependent upon what other devices are installed, the
    total computer memory size, and other factors.  Under  Windows 8/10/11 32-Bit,
    the  amount  of memory that Windows may grant during startup is typically lim-
    ited to 1024 MiByte, but not more than  half  of  the  computer  memory  size.
    Under Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit, the amount of memory that Windows may grant dur-
    ing startup has not yet been determined, but is probably similar to the  limit
    for  Windows Vista 64-Bit: the smaller of 6 GiByte or one half of the computer
    memory size.

       Windows may provide less frame buffer memory than  was  requested.   If  no
    memory  could  be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not be available,
    stating `Can't allocate frame buffer memory'.   Otherwise,  within  XCAP,  the
    number  of  available  frame  buffers  can be checked under PIXCI(R), PIXCI(R)
    Video Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once  during
    Windows  initialization; the contents of frame buffers are retained as XCAP is
    closed and restarted, but lost if Windows is restarted.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    1.B.3  Windows 8/10/11 32/64-Bit - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As described above, frame buffer memory allocated by EPIXXCW2.SYS for  Win-
    dows 8/10 32-Bit,  or  EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit, during Windows
    startup may be limited to a small percentage of total computer memory.   Under
    Windows 8/10 32-Bit,  the  amount  of  memory  that  Windows  may grant during
    startup is typically limited to 1024 MiByte, but not more  than  half  of  the
    computer memory size.  Under Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit, the amount of memory that
    Windows may grant during startup has not yet been determined, but is  probably
    similar  to the limit for Windows Vista 64-Bit: the smaller of 6 GiByte or one
    half of the computer memory size.  Some computer and/or Windows configurations
    may have lower limits.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory  recognized  by  Windows,  and  then  instructing  EPIXXCW2.SYS  for  Win-
    dows 8/10 32-Bit,  or  EPIXXCW6.SYS  for Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit, to explicitly
    use a section of memory without allocating it from Windows.

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    configuration  of  forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.  The following
    information allows manual configuration, correcting problems,  or  integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Use  the  Windows'  BCDEDIT  utility to create a copy of the `{CURRENT}'
          boot entry, set the new entry use limit memory usage  via  `truncatemem-
          ory', and changing the new entry's description.

             Typical commands are:

                   BCDEDIT  /enum

          to list current entries and obtain the current entry's description,

                   BCDEDIT  /copy  {current}  /d  "CURRENT_ENTRY_DESCRIPTION [PIXCI=##M NT=##M"

          to  create a new entry with modified description and boot prompt includ-
          ing a reminder of the amount of memory provided to Windows  and  to  the
          PIXCI(R) imaging card,

                   BCDEDIT /enum  /v

          to get the ID of the new entry, and:

                   BCDEDIT /set <new_entry_id> truncatememory <memory_size>

          to limit the Windows memory size to <memory_size>, in bytes.

             Also using BCDEDIT change the timeout selection to be greater than 0:

                   BCDEDIT /timeout 30

          Otherwise  the boot configuration options will not be shown when Windows
          starts.

          for Windows 8/10 32-Bit, or

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

          for Windows 8/10/11 64-Bit.  On the `PIXCI' field add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory  is
          partitioned  for  the  sake of virtual memory management: (a) Each frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies  that  the  entire image memory is to be handled as one parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating  systems,  the  maximum  number  of partitions is 256 under 64 bit
          operating systems.  For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384  is  sug-
          gested;  though the value need not be a power of two.  Systems with very
          high resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the par-
          tition  size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remaining,
          smaller than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to  the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by not
          mapping the image memory directly into the application program's  space.
          It may also be necessary to append:

                   -MU 0x03

          which  additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only on
          demand.

             Be careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the  specified
          `truncatememory'  limit  -  including exact base2 to base10 conversions!
          Likewise, be certain that the -IA plus -IM  values  do  not  exceed  the
          amount of memory available!

             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory directly below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps  other  hardware
          resources  such  as  BIOS,  memory  mapped I/O, PCI configuration space,
          etc.[1]  and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use as











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          frame buffers.  The usable frame buffer memory is therefore  reduced  by
          the  amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM size
          overlap the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte  address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between  the
          768 MiByte  and  1024 MiByte  addresses may be reserved; the -IA address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Restart Windows, using the newly added boot selection.  Note that  using
          Windows'  Shutdown  instead of Restart may delay Windows' recognition of
          these changes until the second subsequent shutdown!

       For example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating  256 MiByte
    for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             BCDEDIT /set NEW_ENTRY_ID truncatememory 268435456

    and use:

             PIXCI = -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  registry  entry.   Note  that  262144  is  256x1024,  and  786432  is
    (1024-256)x1024.

       Note that if this memory allocation method is used, program access to image
    data  may  be slower.  Thus, the video display rate (and image processing) may
    be slower, but the video capture  rate  (such  as  sequence  capture)  is  not
    adversely  affected.   This  method of memory allocation is primarily used for
    video rate acquisition of long sequences, followed  by  off-line  analysis  or
    saving of the sequence.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with an USB autho-
                rization key.  XCAP-Lite is provided with a software Activation ID
                Code.

                   The Blue (older) or Green (newer) authorization USB key has the
                size and shape of a USB thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm) with a stan-
                dard  USB-A  4-pin connector.  If provided, connect the authoriza-
                tion key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached,  to  the  USB  port
                while  XCAP  is  running.  If the authorization key is missing, or
                disconnected while XCAP is running, then  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std  or
                XCAP-Ltd,  will  behave similar to the XCAP-Lite version; selected
                image processing and analysis tools will not be operational.

            b.  Upon first use, XCAP will prompt  for  configuration  as  per  the
                authorization  key  (including  installation  of  drivers), or the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently, use Change Setup under Utilities - Program  Setup
                within  XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The PIXCI(R) frame grabber's driver may be installed  in  response
                to the Windows Device Manager's prompts (it will prompt once after
                detecting a newly installed card) and pointing the Device  Manager
                to  Drivers\Win7  for Windows 7 32-Bit or Drivers\Win7x64 for Win-
                dows 7 64-Bit within the chosen installation directory, or may  be
                installed  during  XCAP's  installation  (such  as  via  the XCAP-
                WIN32.EXE or XCAPWIN64.EXE installer), or may be installed by  the
                PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant feature within XCAP.

                   Alternately,   the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  can  be
                installed as follows.

            b.  Open the Windows Device  Manager  by  clicking  `Start',  `Control
                Panel',  `System  & Security', `System', and `Device Manager'.  In
                the Device Manager look for an entry  with  a  yellow  exclamation
                mark  that  is  labeled  `Multimedia Controller' or `Coprocessor'.
                Double-click on the entry and then click  the  `Update  Driver...'
                button.   In  the  `Update  Driver  Software' window that pops-up,
                select `Browse my computer for driver software';  in  the  `Search
                for  driver software in this location' enter path Drivers\Win7 for
                Windows 7 32-Bit, or Drivers\Win7x64 for Windows 7 64-Bit,  within
                the  chosen  installation  directory (typically C:\XCAP or C:\Pro-
                gram Files\EPIX\XCAP), and click `Next'.  A window asks `Would you
                like to install this device software?'; click `Install'.  A window
                reports `The  software  for  this  device  has  been  successfully
                installed' and `The hardware you installed will not work until you










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                restart your computer'; click `Finish' and restart Windows.

            c.  Alternately,  using  the   Windows   Explorer,   highlight   Driv-
                ers\Win7\EPIXXCW2.INF     for     Windows 7 32-Bit     or    Driv-
                ers\Win7x64\EPIXXCW6.INF for Windows 7 64-Bit  within  the  chosen
                installation  directory,  right-click  and  select  `Install', and
                restart Windows.

      4.  Restart Windows.

      5.  XCAP is now ready to run, by  clicking  the  optional  shortcut,  or  by
          clicking `Start', `Programs', `XCAP Imaging', and finally `XCAP for Win-
          dows'.

    1.D.1  Windows 7 32/64-Bit - Frame Grabber Driver Installation Details

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber's driver consists of files:

             EPIXXCW2.INF
             EPIXXCW2.CAT
             EPIXXCW2.SYS

    for Windows 7 32-Bit, or files:

             EPIXXCW6.INF
             EPIXXCW6.CAT
             EPIXXCW6.SYS

    for  Windows 7 64-Bit.   Driver  files  for  different  versions  of  Windows,
    although  with  the  same  file name, may have different digital signatures as
    required by each version of Windows.

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber driver is installed by the Windows  Device  Man-
    ager, or by PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant within XCAP.

       Installation copies the driver files and creates registry entry:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

    for Windows 7 32-Bit, or

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

    for  Windows 7 64-Bit.   Most  values within the registry entry are set by the
    Device Manager and should not be modified.  The value:












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             PIXCI   =  -IM <memorysize>  ...

    may be created upon installation, added or modified by XCAP, or can  be  added
    or  modified  manually (i.e. via the Registry Editor (REGEDIT)); its component
    value(s) are Driver Configuration Parameters, as described below.


    1.D.2  Windows 7 32/64-Bit - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       Under Windows 7 32/64-Bit, frame buffer memory  must  be  allocated  during
    Windows' initialization.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of frame buffer memory allocation.   The  following  information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

       The requested frame buffer memory size must be specified  in  the  Registry
    entry described above, using an entry named `PIXCI', such as:

             PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing  the  `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.  If no
    frame buffer memory size is specified, a  default  size  of  32768 KiBytes  is
    used.  Windows must be restarted for the new specification to take effect.

       Optionally,

             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is  to  be  allocated  in blocks or partitions of the stated size.  Requesting
    memory partitioned into blocks may allow receiving more memory that  would  be
    available  as  a  single  block.   However, (a) Each frame buffer must be com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems, the maximum number of partitions is 256
    under 64 bit operating systems.  Systems with  very  high  resolution  cameras
    using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully, so as to
    minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller than a frame  buffer,  at  the
    end of each partition.

       For  the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board frame buffer memory,
    memory reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer  (approximately
    1  MiByte)  and  optionally for support of time stamping of captured frames as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of  frame  buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are needed for
    each frame buffer's capture status.

       Windows 7 32/64-Bit limits the maximum amount of allocatable  frame  buffer
    memory,  dependent  upon  what other devices are installed, the total computer










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    memory size, and other factors.  Under Windows 7 32-Bit, the amount of  memory
    that Windows may grant during startup is typically limited to 1024 MiByte, but
    not more than half of the computer memory size.  Under  Windows 7 64-Bit,  the
    amount of memory that Windows may grant during startup has not yet been deter-
    mined, but is probably similar to the  limit  for  Windows  Vista 64-Bit:  the
    smaller of 6 GiByte or one half of the computer memory size.

       Windows  may  provide  less  frame buffer memory than was requested.  If no
    memory could be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not  be  available,
    stating  `Can't  allocate  frame  buffer memory'.  Otherwise, within XCAP, the
    number of available frame buffers can  be  checked  under  PIXCI(R),  PIXCI(R)
    Video  Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once during
    Windows initialization; the contents of frame buffers are retained as XCAP  is
    closed and restarted, but lost if Windows is restarted.


    1.D.3  Windows 7 32/64-Bit - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As  described above, frame buffer memory allocated by EPIXXCW2.SYS for Win-
    dows 7 32-Bit, or EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows 7 64-Bit,  during  Windows  startup
    may  be  limited  to  a small percentage of total computer memory.  Under Win-
    dows 7 32-Bit, the amount of memory that Windows may grant during  startup  is
    typically  limited to 1024 MiByte, but not more than half of the computer mem-
    ory size.  Under Windows 7 64-Bit, the amount of memory that Windows may grant
    during  startup  has  not  yet been determined, but is probably similar to the
    limit for Windows Vista 64-Bit: the smaller of 6 GiByte or  one  half  of  the
    computer  memory  size.   Some computer and/or Windows configurations may have
    lower limits.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory  recognized  by  Windows,  and  then  instructing  EPIXXCW2.SYS  for  Win-
    dows 7 32-Bit, or EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows 7 64-Bit, to explicitly use a  sec-
    tion of memory without allocating it from Windows.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.   The  following
    information  allows  manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Use the Windows' BCDEDIT utility to create a  copy  of  the  `{CURRENT}'
          boot  entry,  set the new entry use limit memory usage via `truncatemem-
          ory', and changing the new entry's description.

             Typical commands are:

                   BCDEDIT  /enum

          to list current entries and obtain the current entry's description,

                   BCDEDIT  /copy  {current}  /d  "CURRENT_ENTRY_DESCRIPTION [PIXCI=##M NT=##M"

          to create a new entry with modified description and boot prompt  includ-
          ing  a  reminder  of the amount of memory provided to Windows and to the










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          PIXCI(R) imaging card,

                   BCDEDIT /enum  /v

          to get the ID of the new entry, and:

                   BCDEDIT /set <new_entry_id> truncatememory <memory_size>

          to limit the Windows memory size to <memory_size>, in bytes.

             Also using BCDEDIT change the timeout selection to be greater than 0:

                   BCDEDIT /timeout 30

          Otherwise the boot configuration options will not be shown when  Windows
          starts.

      2.  Edit the registry entry:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

          for Windows 7 32-Bit, or

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

          for Windows 7 64-Bit.  On the `PIXCI' field add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The  -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory is
          partitioned for the sake of virtual memory  management:  (a) Each  frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies that the entire image memory is to be handled  as  one  parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating systems, the maximum number of partitions  is  256  under  64  bit
          operating  systems.   For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384 is sug-
          gested; though the value need not be a power of two.  Systems with  very
          high resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the par-
          tition size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory  remaining,
          smaller than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by  not
          mapping  the image memory directly into the application program's space.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          It may also be necessary to append:

                   -MU 0x03

          which additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only  on
          demand.

             Be  careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the specified
          `truncatememory' limit - including exact base2  to  base10  conversions!
          Likewise,  be  certain  that  the  -IA plus -IM values do not exceed the
          amount of memory available!

             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory  directly  below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps other hardware
          resources such as BIOS, memory  mapped  I/O,  PCI  configuration  space,
          etc.[2] and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use  as
          frame  buffers.   The usable frame buffer memory is therefore reduced by
          the amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM  size
          overlap  the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On  computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between the
          768 MiByte and 1024 MiByte addresses may be reserved;  the  -IA  address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Restart Windows, using the newly added boot selection.

       For  example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating 256 MiByte
    for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             BCDEDIT /set NEW_ENTRY_ID truncatememory 268435456

    and use:

             PIXCI = -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  registry  entry.   Note  that  262144  is  256x1024,  and  786432  is
    (1024-256)x1024.

       Note that if this memory allocation method is used, program access to image
    data may be slower.  Thus, the video display rate (and image  processing)  may
    be  slower,  but  the  video  capture  rate  (such as sequence capture) is not
    adversely affected.  This method of memory allocation is  primarily  used  for
    video  rate  acquisition  of  long sequences, followed by off-line analysis or
    saving of the sequence.

    1.D.4  Windows 7 32/64-Bit - Authorization Key - Manual Installation

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    installation of the authorization key's driver(s).

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures.


    1.D.4.a  USB Authorization Blue Keys.  Run the authorization key utility  pro-
    gram provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\Win7+\HASPDINST -install

    or

             HARDLOCK\Win7+\HASPDINST -help

    for  additional  options.   The  authorization  key's  vendor does not provide
    detailed information regarding installation of drivers for USB port authoriza-
    tion keys.


    1.D.4.b  USB  Authorization  Green  Keys.   Attach the USB green key.  Run the
    Windows Device Manager, look for  the  `USBKEY',  `USBKEY64',  or  `Keylok  2'
    device, ask the Device Manager to install or update the driver for the device,
    pointing the Device Manager to XCAP's chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    and subdirectory:

             Keylok\i386\WinXP+

    for 32-Bit Windows, or subdirectory:

             Keylok\x86_64\WinXP+

    for 64-Bit Windows.


    1.E  For Windows Vista 32/64-Bit

      1.  Install Files:












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


            a.  If XCAP is provided on a CD or DVD:

                  i.  If  your  computer  is set to allow automatic execution of a
                      loaded CD/DVD, the CD/DVD's interactive index  program  will
                      be  executed  automatically.   Otherwise,  execute the index
                      program, from a Command Prompt (i.e. Windows  Terminal),  or
                      via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                               > Z:SETUP       (replace Z with drive letter for your CD/DVD)

                 ii.  Select  `Setup  PIXCI(R) Imaging Software' and `XCAP Imaging
                      Application  for  Windows  10/8/7/Vista/XP/2000  32-Bit'  or
                      `XCAP  Imaging  Application  for  Windows 11/10/8/7/Vista/XP
                      64-Bit'.  Click `OK'.

                iii.  Follow the installation program's  directions,  such  as  to
                      select  an installation directory.  The default installation
                      directory  is   nominally   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP,   or
                      C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP  for  installation of 32-bit
                      XCAP on 64-bit Windows, but depends on the current  Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN32.EXE (for 32-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      or

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN64.EXE (for 64-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      from the EPIX, Inc. ftp site.

                 ii.  Execute  the downloaded program, from a Command Prompt (i.e.
                      Windows Terminal), or via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                           > XCAPWIN32.EXE     (for 32-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      or

                           > XCAPWIN64.EXE     (for 64-bit XCAP for Windows)

                iii.  Follow the installation program's  directions,  such  as  to
                      select  an installation directory.  The default installation
                      directory  is   nominally   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP,   or
                      C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP  for  installation of 32-bit
                      XCAP on 64-bit Windows, but depends on the current  Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

                 iv.  The downloaded .EXE file may be deleted.












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


            c.  The installation procedure creates a new program group, containing
                XCAP and several  .TXT  files.   The  *.TXT  files  contain  these
                installation  instructions,  a  list of distributed files, correc-
                tions or additions to this manual, or  other  up-to-date  informa-
                tion.   The  PCITIPS.TXT file provides the PCI Configuration Tips,
                with tips for resolving  hardware  and  software  conflicts.   The
                installation  procedure also, optionally, creates a desktop short-
                cut for XCAP.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with an USB  autho-
                rization key.  XCAP-Lite is provided with a software Activation ID
                Code.

                   The Blue (older) or Green (newer) authorization USB key has the
                size and shape of a USB thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm) with a stan-
                dard USB-A 4-pin connector.  If provided, connect  the  authoriza-
                tion key to a USB port.

                   The  authorization  key  must  remain attached, to the USB port
                while XCAP is running.  If the authorization key  is  missing,  or
                disconnected  while  XCAP  is running, then XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std or
                XCAP-Ltd, will behave similar to the XCAP-Lite  version;  selected
                image processing and analysis tools will not be operational.

            b.  Upon  first  use,  XCAP  will  prompt for configuration as per the
                authorization key (including  installation  of  drivers),  or  the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently,  use Change Setup under Utilities - Program Setup
                within XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the  authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The  PIXCI(R)  frame grabber's driver may be installed in response
                to the Windows Device Manager's prompts (it will prompt once after
                detecting  a newly installed card) and pointing the Device Manager
                to Drivers\WinVS for Windows Vista 32-Bit or  Drivers\WinVS64  for
                Windows Vista 64-Bit  within the chosen installation directory, or
                may be installed during XCAP's installation (such as via the XCAP-
                WIN32.EXE  or XCAPWIN64.EXE installer), or may be installed by the
                PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant feature within XCAP.

                   Alternately,  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  can   be
                installed as follows.

            b.  Click  `Start', `Control Panel', `System and Maintenance'.  Select
                `Device Manager' and under `Other Devices'  or  `Imaging  Devices'
                double-click  `PCI  MultiMedia  Video  Device' or `Coprocessor' or
                `PIXCI(R) Video Capture Board' (the former two  may  appear  if  a
                PIXCI(R)   driver   was  never  installed,  otherwise  the  latter










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                appears).  A `Properties' window appears;  click  `Driver'  (tab),
                and  `Update Driver'.  An `Update Driver Software' window appears;
                select `Browse my computer  for  driver  (advanced)',  enter  path
                Drivers\WinVS  for  Windows  Vista 32-Bit,  or Drivers\WinVS64 for
                Windows Vista 64-Bit, within  the  chosen  installation  directory
                (typically   C:\XCAP  or  C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP),  and  click
                `Next'.  A window asks `Would you  like  to  install  this  device
                software?';  click  `Install'.  A window reports `The software for
                this device has been successfully installed' and `The hardware you
                installed  will  not  work until you restart your computer'; click
                `Finish' and restart Windows.

            c.  Alternately,  using  the   Windows   Explorer,   highlight   Driv-
                ers\WinVS\EPIXXCW2.INF    for    Windows Vista 32-Bit   or   Driv-
                ers\WinVS64\EPIXXCW6.INF for Windows Vista 64-Bit within the  cho-
                sen  installation directory, right-click and select `Install', and
                restart Windows.

      4.  Configure Graphics Display:

            a.  A `High Color (16 bit or 65536 Color)', `True  Color  (24  bit  or
                16777216  Color)', or `True Color (32 bit)' setting for the graph-
                ics display is required for proper display of images  and  overlay
                graphics.   The  `True  Color (24 bit or 16777216 Color)' or `True
                Color (32 bit)' is suggested for higher quality, and quicker, dis-
                play  of  images and overlay graphics.  This may be checked and/or
                modified via Windows `Start',  `Control  Panel',  `Appearance  and
                Personalization', `Personalization', `Display Settings'.

      5.  Restart Windows.

      6.  XCAP  is  now  ready  to  run,  by clicking the optional shortcut, or by
          clicking `Start', `Programs', `XCAP Imaging', and finally `XCAP for Win-
          dows'.

    1.F.1  Windows Vista 32/64-Bit - Frame Grabber Driver Installation Details

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber's driver consists of files:

             EPIXXCW2.INF
             EPIXXCW2.CAT
             EPIXXCW2.SYS

    for Windows Vista 32-Bit, or files:













    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             EPIXXCW6.INF
             EPIXXCW6.CAT
             EPIXXCW6.SYS

    for  Windows Vista 64-Bit.   Driver  files  for different versions of Windows,
    although with the same file name, may have  different  digital  signatures  as
    required by each version of Windows.

       The  PIXCI(R)  frame grabber driver is installed by the Windows Device Man-
    ager, or by PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant within XCAP.

       Installation copies the driver files and creates registry entry:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

    for Windows Vista 32-Bit, or

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

    for Windows Vista 64-Bit.  Most values within the registry entry  are  set  by
    the Device Manager and should not be modified.  The value:

             PIXCI   =  -IM <memorysize>  ...

    may  be  created upon installation, added or modified by XCAP, or can be added
    or modified manually (i.e. via the Registry Editor (REGEDIT));  its  component
    value(s) are Driver Configuration Parameters, as described below.


    1.F.2  Windows Vista 32/64-Bit - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       Under Windows Vista 32/64-Bit, frame buffer memory must be allocated during
    Windows' initialization.

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    configuration  of  frame  buffer memory allocation.  The following information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

       The  requested  frame  buffer memory size must be specified in the Registry
    entry described above, using an entry named `PIXCI', such as:

             PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing the `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.   If  no
    frame  buffer  memory  size  is  specified, a default size of 32768 KiBytes is
    used.  Windows must be restarted for the new specification to take effect.

       Optionally,














    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is to be allocated in blocks or partitions of  the  stated  size.   Requesting
    memory  partitioned  into blocks may allow receiving more memory that would be
    available as a single block.  However, (a) Each  frame  buffer  must  be  com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems, the maximum number of partitions is 256
    under  64  bit  operating  systems.  Systems with very high resolution cameras
    using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully, so as to
    minimize  the  unusable  memory remaining, smaller than a frame buffer, at the
    end of each partition.

       For the PIXCI(R) CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board  frame  buffer  memory,
    memory  reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer (approximately
    1 MiByte) and optionally for support of time stamping of  captured  frames  as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of frame buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are  needed  for
    each frame buffer's capture status.

       Windows Vista 32/64-Bit limits the maximum amount of allocatable frame buf-
    fer memory, dependent upon what other devices are installed,  the  total  com-
    puter  memory size, and other factors.  Under Windows Vista 32-Bit, the amount
    of memory that Windows may  grant  during  startup  is  typically  limited  to
    1024 MiByte,  but  not more than half of the computer memory size.  Under Win-
    dows Vista 64-Bit, the amount of memory that Windows may grant during  startup
    is  typically  limited  to the smaller of 6 GiByte or one half of the computer
    memory size.

       Windows may provide less frame buffer memory than  was  requested.   If  no
    memory  could  be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not be available,
    stating `Can't allocate frame buffer memory'.   Otherwise,  within  XCAP,  the
    number  of  available  frame  buffers  can be checked under PIXCI(R), PIXCI(R)
    Video Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once  during
    Windows  initialization; the contents of frame buffers are retained as XCAP is
    closed and restarted, but lost if Windows is restarted.


    1.F.3  Windows Vista 32/64-Bit - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As described above, frame buffer memory allocated by EPIXXCW2.SYS for  Win-
    dows  Vista 32-Bit,  or  EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows Vista 64-Bit, during Windows
    startup may be limited to a small percentage of total computer memory.   Under
    Windows  Vista 32-Bit,  the  amount  of  memory  that Windows may grant during
    startup is typically limited to 1024 MiByte, but not more  than  half  of  the
    computer  memory  size.  Under Windows Vista 64-Bit, the amount of memory that
    Windows may grant during startup  is  typically  limited  to  the  smaller  of
    6 GiByte  or  one half of the computer memory size.  Some computer and/or Win-
    dows configurations may have lower limits.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory  recognized  by  Windows,  and  then  instructing EPIXXCW2.SYS for Windows
    Vista 32-Bit, or EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows Vista 64-Bit, to  explicitly  use  a
    section of memory without allocating it from Windows.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.   The  following
    information  allows  manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Use the Windows' BCDEDIT utility to create a  copy  of  the  `{CURRENT}'
          boot  entry,  set the new entry use limit memory usage via `truncatemem-
          ory', and changing the new entry's description.

             Typical commands are:

                   BCDEDIT  /enum

          to list current entries and obtain the current entry's description,

                   BCDEDIT  /copy  {current}  /d  "CURRENT_ENTRY_DESCRIPTION [PIXCI=##M NT=##M"

          to create a new entry with modified description and boot prompt  includ-
          ing  a  reminder  of the amount of memory provided to Windows and to the
          PIXCI(R) imaging card,

                   BCDEDIT /enum  /v

          to get the ID of the new entry, and:

                   BCDEDIT /set <new_entry_id> truncatememory <memory_size>

          to limit the Windows memory size to <memory_size>, in bytes.

             Also using BCDEDIT change the timeout selection to be greater than 0:

                   BCDEDIT /timeout 30

          Otherwise the boot configuration options will not be shown when  Windows
          starts.

      2.  Edit the registry entry:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

          for Windows Vista 32-Bit, or

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

          for Windows Vista 64-Bit.  On the `PIXCI' field add:













    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The  -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory is
          partitioned for the sake of virtual memory  management:  (a) Each  frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies that the entire image memory is to be handled  as  one  parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating systems, the maximum number of partitions  is  256  under  64  bit
          operating  systems.   For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384 is sug-
          gested; though the value need not be a power of two.  Systems with  very
          high resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the par-
          tition size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory  remaining,
          smaller than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by  not
          mapping  the image memory directly into the application program's space.
          It may also be necessary to append:

                   -MU 0x03

          which additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only  on
          demand.

             Be  careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the specified
          `truncatememory' limit - including exact base2  to  base10  conversions!
          Likewise,  be  certain  that  the  -IA plus -IM values do not exceed the
          amount of memory available!

             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory  directly  below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps other hardware
          resources such as BIOS, memory  mapped  I/O,  PCI  configuration  space,
          etc.[3] and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use  as
          frame  buffers.   The usable frame buffer memory is therefore reduced by
          the amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM  size
          overlap  the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not  specified)  if  the  computer  has

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          significantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On  computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between the
          768 MiByte and 1024 MiByte addresses may be reserved;  the  -IA  address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Restart Windows, using the newly added boot selection.

       For  example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating 256 MiByte
    for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             BCDEDIT /set NEW_ENTRY_ID truncatememory 268435456

    and use:

             PIXCI = -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  registry  entry.   Note  that  262144  is  256x1024,  and  786432  is
    (1024-256)x1024.

       Note that if this memory allocation method is used, program access to image
    data may be slower.  Thus, the video display rate (and image  processing)  may
    be  slower,  but  the  video  capture  rate  (such as sequence capture) is not
    adversely affected.  This method of memory allocation is  primarily  used  for
    video  rate  acquisition  of  long sequences, followed by off-line analysis or
    saving of the sequence.


    1.F.4  Windows Vista 32/64-Bit - Authorization Key - Manual Installation

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    installation of the authorization key's driver(s).

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures.


    1.F.4.a  USB Authorization Blue Keys.  Run the authorization key utility  pro-
    gram provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -install

    or

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -help

    for  additional  options.   The  authorization  key's  vendor does not provide
    detailed information regarding installation of drivers for USB port authoriza-
    tion keys.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    1.F.4.b  USB  Authorization  Green  Keys.   Attach the USB green key.  Run the
    Windows Device Manager, look for  the  `USBKEY',  `USBKEY64',  or  `Keylok  2'
    device, ask the Device Manager to install or update the driver for the device,
    pointing the Device Manager to XCAP's chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    and subdirectory:

             Keylok\i386\WinXP+

    for 64-Bit Windows.


    1.G  For Windows XP, XP(x64)

      1.  Install Files:

            a.  If XCAP is provided on a CD or DVD:

                  i.  If your computer is set to allow automatic  execution  of  a
                      loaded  CD/DVD,  the CD/DVD's interactive index program will
                      be executed automatically.   Otherwise,  execute  the  index
                      program,  from  a Command Prompt (i.e. Windows Terminal), or
                      via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                               > Z:SETUP       (replace Z with drive letter for your CD/DVD)

                 ii.  Select `Setup PIXCI(R) Imaging Software' and  `XCAP  Imaging
                      Application  for  Windows  10/8/7/Vista/XP/2000  32-Bit'  or
                      `XCAP Imaging  Application  for  Windows  11/10/8/7/Vista/XP
                      64-Bit'.  Click `OK'.

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory   is   nominally   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP,  or
                      C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP for installation  of  32-bit
                      XCAP  on 64-bit Windows, but depends on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN32.EXE (for 32-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      or












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN64.EXE (for 64-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      from the EPIX, Inc. ftp site.

                 ii.  Execute the downloaded program, from a Command Prompt  (i.e.
                      Windows Terminal), or via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                           > XCAPWIN32.EXE     (for 32-bit XCAP for Windows)

                      or

                           > XCAPWIN64.EXE     (for 64-bit XCAP for Windows)

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory   is   nominally   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP,  or
                      C:\Program Files(x86)\EPIX\XCAP for installation  of  32-bit
                      XCAP  on 64-bit Windows, but depends on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

                 iv.  The downloaded .EXE file may be deleted.

            c.  The installation procedure creates a new program group, containing
                XCAP  and  several  .TXT  files.   The  *.TXT  files contain these
                installation instructions, a list of  distributed  files,  correc-
                tions  or  additions  to this manual, or other up-to-date informa-
                tion.  The PCITIPS.TXT file provides the PCI  Configuration  Tips,
                with  tips  for  resolving  hardware  and software conflicts.  The
                installation procedure also, optionally, creates a desktop  short-
                cut for XCAP.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with a printer port
                authorization key or an USB authorization key.  XCAP-Lite is  pro-
                vided with a software Activation ID Code.

                   The  printer  port authorization key is black and approximately
                the  size  and  shape  of  a  printer's  parallel  port  connector
                (5.5x4.5x1.6 cm),  but  with  two 25-pin connectors.  If provided,
                connect the authorization key to any printer port.  If  a  printer
                cable  was  attached  to  the  printer port, reconnect the printer
                cable to the back of the authorization key; the authorization  key
                will not affect normal printer operation.  The printer port autho-
                rization key is only supported on Intel i386 platforms.

                   Do not connect the printer port authorization key to  a  25-pin
                serial  (RS-232)  port,  or to any other interface that happens to
                use the same style connector; the authorization key will not func-
                tion, might be permanently damaged, and the warranty will be void!

                   The Blue (older) or Green (newer) authorization USB key has the
                size and shape of a  USB  thumb  drive  (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm)  with  a










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                standard  USB-A  4-pin connector.  If provided, connect the autho-
                rization key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached, to the printer port
                or  USB port as appropriate, while XCAP is running.  If the autho-
                rization key is missing, or disconnected while  XCAP  is  running,
                then  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std or XCAP-Ltd, will behave similar to the
                XCAP-Lite version; selected image processing  and  analysis  tools
                will not be operational.

            b.  Upon  first  use,  XCAP  will  prompt for configuration as per the
                authorization key (including  installation  of  drivers),  or  the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently,  use Change Setup under Utilities - Program Setup
                within XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the  authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The  PIXCI(R)  frame grabber's driver may be installed in response
                to the Windows Device Manager's prompts (it will prompt once after
                detecting  a newly installed card) and pointing the Device Manager
                to Drivers\WinXP for Windows XP 32-Bit or Drivers\WinXP64 for Win-
                dows XP 64-Bit within the chosen installation directory, or may be
                installed during  XCAP's  installation  (such  as  via  the  XCAP-
                WIN32.EXE  or XCAPWIN64.EXE installer), or may be installed by the
                PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant feature within XCAP.

                   Alternately,  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  can   be
                installed as follows.

            b.  Click  `Start',  `Control  Panel',  `Performance and Maintenance',
                `System', `Hardware', `Device Manager', and under `Other  Devices'
                or `Imaging Devices' double-click `PCI MultiMedia Video Device' or
                `PIXCI(R) Video Capture Board' (the latter appears if  a  PIXCI(R)

    1.H  Windows XP, XP(x64) Esoterica



    1.H.1  Windows XP, XP(x64) - Frame Grabber Driver Installation Details

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber's driver consists of files:

             EPIXXCW2.INF
             EPIXXCW2.CAT
             EPIXXCW2.SYS

    for Windows XP 32-Bit, or files:

             EPIXXCW6.INF
             EPIXXCW6.CAT
             EPIXXCW6.SYS

    for Windows XP 64-Bit.   Driver  files  for  different  versions  of  Windows,
    although  with  the  same  file name, may have different digital signatures as
    required by each version of Windows.

       The PIXCI(R) frame grabber driver is installed by the Windows  Device  Man-
    ager, or by PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant within XCAP.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       Installation copies the driver files and creates registry entry:

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

    for Windows XP 32-Bit, or

             HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

    for  Windows XP 64-Bit.   Most values within the registry entry are set by the
    Device Manager and should not be modified.  The value:

             PIXCI   =  -IM <memorysize>  ...

    may be created upon installation, added or modified by XCAP, or can  be  added
    or  modified  manually (i.e. via the Registry Editor (REGEDIT)); its component
    value(s) are Driver Configuration Parameters, as described below.


    1.H.2  Windows XP, XP(x64) - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       Under Windows XP or XP(x64), frame buffer memory must be  allocated  during
    Windows' initialization.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of frame buffer memory allocation.   The  following  information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

       The requested frame buffer memory size must be specified  in  the  Registry
    entry described above, using an entry named `PIXCI', such as:

             PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing  the  `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.  If no
    frame buffer memory size is specified, a  default  size  of  32768 KiBytes  is
    used.  Windows must be restarted for the new specification to take effect.

       Optionally,

             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is  to  be  allocated  in blocks or partitions of the stated size.  Requesting
    memory partitioned into blocks may allow receiving more memory that  would  be
    available  as  a  single  block.   However, (a) Each frame buffer must be com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems, the maximum number of partitions is 256
    under 64 bit operating systems.  Systems with  very  high  resolution  cameras
    using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully, so as to
    minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller than a frame  buffer,  at  the










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    end of each partition.

       For  the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board frame buffer memory,
    memory reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer  (approximately
    1 MiByte)  and  optionally  for support of time stamping of captured frames as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of  frame  buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are needed for
    each frame buffer's capture status.

       Windows XP or XP(x64), limits the maximum amount of allocatable frame  buf-
    fer  memory,  dependent  upon what other devices are installed, the total com-
    puter memory size, and other factors.  Under Windows XP the maximum amount  of
    memory  that  can  be  allocated  by  this  method  is  typically  limited  to
    512 MiByte, but not more than half of  the  physical  memory.   Under  Windows
    XP(x64), the typical amount of allocated memory has not yet been determined.

       Windows  may  provide  less  frame buffer memory than was requested.  If no
    memory could be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not  be  available,
    stating  `Can't  allocate  frame  buffer memory'.  Otherwise, within XCAP, the
    number of available frame buffers can  be  checked  under  PIXCI(R),  PIXCI(R)
    Video  Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once during
    Windows initialization; the contents of frame buffers are retained as XCAP  is
    closed and restarted, but lost if Windows is restarted.


    1.H.3  Windows XP, XP(x64) - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As  described above, frame buffer memory allocated by EPIXXCW2.SYS for Win-
    dows XP, or EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows XP(x64), during Windows  startup  may  be
    limited to a small percentage of total computer memory.  Under Windows XP, the
    amount of memory that Windows may grant during startup is typically limited to
    512 MiByte, but not more than half of the computer memory size.  Under Windows
    XP(x64), the amount of memory that Windows may grant during startup  is  typi-
    cally limited to the computer memory size minus 1 GiByte, but not more than 27
    Gbyte.  Some computer and/or Windows configurations may have lower limits.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory recognized by Windows and then instructing EPIXXCW2.SYS for Windows XP, or
    EPIXXCW6.SYS for Windows XP(x64), to explicitly use a section of memory  with-
    out allocating it from Windows.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.   The  following
    information  allows  manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Edit C:\BOOT.INI, restricting Windows XP or XP(x64), to use no more than
          a  set  amount  of  memory:  by  copying an existing configuration line,
          adding /MAXMEM=XX (where XX is the memory size in MiByte)  and  changing
          the prompt name.  For example, changing:













    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   [operating systems]
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows XP"

          to:

                   [operating systems]
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows XP [NT=64M PIXCI=256M]"  /MAXMEM=64
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows XP"

          Do  not copy this new line as shown above; the first portion of the line
          must be copied from an existing configuration line in  your  C:\BOOT.INI
          file.   The  text between quotes appears as a boot selection prompt, use
          of `[NT=64M PIXCI=256M]' is a suggested reminder, but not required.

             Also in C:\BOOT.INI, change the timeout selection to be greater  than
          0:

                   [boot loader]
                   timeout=30

          Otherwise the BOOT.INI configuration options will not be shown when Win-
          dows starts.

             Keeping the original configuration line, as a boot selection  option,
          is highly recommended as a backup.

             Under  Windows XP, the BOOTCFG command, provided with Windows, can be
          used to change the BOOT.INI file instead of manual editing.

      2.  Edit the registry entry:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

          for Windows XP, or

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW6

          for Windows XP(x64).  On the `PIXCI' field add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory  is
          partitioned  for  the  sake of virtual memory management: (a) Each frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies  that  the  entire image memory is to be handled as one parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating  systems,  the  maximum  number  of partitions is 256 under 64 bit
          operating systems.  For most systems,  a  value  of  8192  or  16384  is










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          suggested;  though  the  value need not be a power of two.  Systems with
          very high resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the
          partition  size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remain-
          ing, smaller than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to  the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by not
          mapping the image memory directly into the application program's  space.
          It may also be necessary to append:

                   -MU 0x03

          which  additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only on
          demand.

             Be careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the  specified
          /MAXMEM  limit - including exact base2 to base10 conversions!  (i.e. for
          /MAXMEM=64, the smallest valid value  of  -IA  is  65536,  not  64000!).
          Likewise,  be  certain  that  the  -IA plus -IM values do not exceed the
          amount of memory available!

             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory  directly  below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps other hardware
          resources such as BIOS, memory  mapped  I/O,  PCI  configuration  space,
          etc.[4] and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use  as
          frame  buffers.   The usable frame buffer memory is therefore reduced by
          the amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM  size
          overlap  the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On  computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between the
          768 MiByte and 1024 MiByte addresses may be reserved;  the  -IA  address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Restart Windows, using the newly added boot selection.

       For  example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating 256 MiByte
    for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

        Corp.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             /MAXMEM=256

    in C:\BOOT.INI, and use:

             PIXCI = -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  registry  entry.   Note  that  262144  is  256x1024,  and  786432  is
    (1024-256)x1024.

       Note that if this memory allocation method is used, program access to image
    data may be slower.  Thus, the video display rate (and image  processing)  may
    be  slower,  but  the  video  capture  rate  (such as sequence capture) is not
    adversely affected.  This method of memory allocation is  primarily  used  for
    video  rate  acquisition  of  long sequences, followed by off-line analysis or
    saving of the sequence.


    1.H.4  Windows XP, XP(x64) - Authorization Key - Manual Installation

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    installation of the authorization key's driver(s).

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures.


    1.H.4.a  Printer Port Authorization Keys.  Printer port authorization keys are
    not supported on Windows XP(x64).

       Run  the authorization key utility program provided with XCAP from the cho-
    sen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -install

    or:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -help

    for additional options.

       The following information allows manual installation, correcting  problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures for the printer port version of autho-
    rization keys.

      1.  The file HARDLOCK.SYS must be copied  to  the  Windows  SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
          directory, typically:













    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

      2.  Using  the  Registry  Editor  (REGEDIT) provided with Windows, create an
          entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HardLock

          This key must contain values:

                   ErrorControl  =  0x00000001
                   Group         =  "Extended Base"
                   Start         =  0x00000002
                   Type          =  0x00000001

          or, if using REGEDT32, the values should appear as:

                   ErrorControl:REG_DWORD:0x1
                   Group:REG_SZ:ExtendedBase
                   Start:REG_DWORD:0x2
                   Type:REG_DWORD:0x1

      3.  Shut down and restart Windows for  the  new  registry  entries  to  take
          effect.

      4.  If the authorization key is connected to a non-standard printer port, an
          additional entry may be required:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HardLock\Parameters

          which contains a value:

                   IoPortAddress0  = 0x????            (for REGEDIT)
                   IoPortAddress0:REG_DWORD:0x????     (for REGEDT32)

          where the `????'  is replaced with the parallel port's  I/O  address  in
          hexadecimal.  As before, Windows must be shut down and restarted.

                      Application for Windows 10/8/7/Vista/XP/2000 32-Bit'.  Click
                      `OK'.

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory  was  formerly  C:\XCAP  and  will  be reused when
                      updating a legacy installation.   The  default  installation
                      directory   for   new  installations  is  nominally  C:\Pro-
                      gram Files\EPIX\XCAP.  but depends on the  current  Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:













    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN32.EXE (for 32-bit Windows 2000 & later)

                      from the EPIX, Inc. ftp site.

                 ii.  Execute  the  downloaded  program, from a Command Prompt, or
                      via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                           > XCAPWIN32.EXE             (for 32-bit Windows 2000 & later)

                iii.  Follow the installation program's  directions,  such  as  to
                      select  an installation directory.  The default installation
                      directory was formerly  C:\XCAP  and  will  be  reused  when
                      updating  a  legacy  installation.  The default installation
                      directory  for  new  installations  is   nominally   C:\Pro-
                      gram Files\EPIX\XCAP,  but  depends  on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

                 iv.  The downloaded .EXE file may be deleted.

            c.  The installation procedure creates a new program group, containing
                XCAP  and  several  .TXT  files.   The  *.TXT  files contain these
                installation instructions, a list of  distributed  files,  correc-
                tions  or  additions  to this manual, or other up-to-date informa-
                tion.  The PCITIPS.TXT file provides the PCI  Configuration  Tips,
                with  tips  for  resolving  hardware  and software conflicts.  The
                installation procedure also, optionally, creates a desktop  short-
                cut for XCAP.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with a printer port
                authorization key or an USB authorization key.  XCAP-Lite is  pro-
                vided with a software Activation ID Code.

                   The  printer  port authorization key is black and approximately
                the  size  and  shape  of  a  printer's  parallel  port  connector
                (5.5x4.5x1.6 cm),  but  with  two 25-pin connectors.  If provided,
                connect the authorization key to any printer port.  If  a  printer
                cable  was  attached  to  the  printer port, reconnect the printer
                cable to the back of the authorization key; the authorization  key
                will not affect normal printer operation.

                   Do  not  connect the printer port authorization key to a 25-pin
                serial (RS-232) port, or to any other interface  that  happens  to
                use the same style connector; the authorization key will not func-
                tion, might be permanently damaged, and the warranty will be void!

                   The Blue authorization USB key has the size and shape of a  USB
                thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm), with a standard USB-A 4-pin connec-
                tor.  If provided, connect the authorization key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached, to the printer port
                or  USB  port  as  appropriate,  while  XCAP  is  running.  If the










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                authorization key is missing, or disconnected while XCAP  is  run-
                ning, then XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std or XCAP-Ltd, will behave similar to
                the XCAP-Lite version;  selected  image  processing  and  analysis
                tools will not be operational.

            b.  Upon  first  use,  XCAP  will  prompt for configuration as per the
                authorization key (including  installation  of  drivers),  or  the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently,  use Change Setup under Utilities - Program Setup
                within XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the  authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The  PIXCI(R)  frame grabber's driver may be installed in response
                to the Windows Device Manager's prompts (it will prompt once after
                detecting  a newly installed card) and pointing the Device Manager
                to Drivers\Win2K within the chosen installation directory, or  may
                be  installed  during  XCAP's  installation (such as via the XCAP-
                WIN32.EXE or XCAPWIN64.EXE installer), or may be installed by  the
                PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant feature within XCAP.

                   Alternately,   the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  can  be
                installed as follows.

            b.  Click `Start', `Settings', `Control Panel', `System' (if  `System'
                is not listed, click on `View all Control Panel options'), `Device
                Manager', and under `Other Devices' or `Imaging  Devices'  double-
                click  `PCI  MultiMedia  Video  Device' or `PIXCI(R) Video Capture
                Board'.  Click `Properties', `Driver', `Change Driver' or  `Update
                Driver'.   A  window  stating  `Welcome' appears; click `Next'.  A
                window stating `This wizard searches for updated drivers for:  PCI
                MultiMedia  Video  Device'  or  `This  wizard searches for updated
                drivers for: PIXCI(R) Video Capture Board' appears; select `Search
                for  a suitable driver for my device (recommended)', click `Next',
                select `Specify a Location', enter path Drivers\Win2K  within  the
                chosen   installation  directory  (typically  C:\XCAP  or  C:\Pro-
                gram Files\EPIX\XCAP), and click `Next', `Next'.  A window reports
                that  Microsoft's  `Digital Signature was not found'; click `Yes'.
                A window reports `This device is not configured  correctly.  (Code
                1)'  (this error indicates that the newly installed driver will be
                functional only after a restart of Windows);  click  `Finish'  and
                restart Windows.

            c.  Alternately,   using   the   Windows   Explorer,  highlight  Driv-
                ers\Win2K\EPIXXCW2.INF within the chosen  installation  directory,
                right-click and select `Install', and restart Windows.

      4.  Configure Graphics Display:

            a.  A  `High  Color  (16  bit or 65536 Color)', `True Color (24 bit or
                16777216 Color)',  or  `True  Color  (32  bit)'  setting  for  the










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                graphics  display  is  required  for  proper display of images and
                overlay graphics.  The `True Color (24 bit or 16777216 Color)'  or
                `True  Color  (32  bit)'  is  suggested  for  higher  quality, and
                quicker, display of images and  overlay  graphics.   This  may  be
                checked  and/or modified via Windows `Start', `Settings', `Control
                Panel', `Display', `Settings'.

            b.  Under `Start', `Settings', `Control Panel', `Display',  `Effects',
                the `Show window contents while dragging' must be disabled.

      5.  Restart Windows.

      6.  XCAP  is  now  ready  to  run,  by clicking the optional shortcut, or by
          clicking `Start', `Programs', `XCAP Imaging', and finally `XCAP for Win-
          dows'.



    1.J  Windows 2000 Esoterica



    1.J.1  Windows 2000 - Manual Installation

       Use  of  EPIXXCW2.INF (or EPIXXCNT.INF for version 2.0 and earlier), above,
    provides automatic installation of EPIXXCW2.SYS (or EPIXXCNT.SYS  for  version
    2.0 and earlier) in most circumstances.  The following information allows man-
    ual installation, correcting problems, or integration  with  an  OEM's  proce-
    dures.

      1.  The  EPIXXCW2.SYS  (or EPIXXCNT.SYS for version 2.0 and earlier) must be
          copied to the Windows SYSTEM32\DRIVERS directory, typically:

                   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

      2.  Using the Registry Editor (REGEDIT) provided  with  Windows,  create  an
          entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2  (version 2.1+)
                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCNT  (version 2.0-)

          This entry must contain:

                   ErrorControl  =  0x00000001
                   Group         =  "Extended base"
                   Start         =  0x00000001
                   Type          =  0x00000001

          and may, as described below, also contain:














    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

          Create an entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System\EPIXXCW2  (version 2.1+)
                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System\EPIXXCNT  (version 2.0-)

          This entry must contain:

                   EventMessageFile = "%SystemRoot%\System32\IoLogMsg.dll"
                   TypesSupported   = 0x00000007

      3.  Shut down and restart Windows.

       Under Windows 2000, the Windows NT driver EPIXXCWT.SYS can be, and was pre-
    viously, used instead of  EPIXXCW2.SYS.   In  contrast  to  EPIXXCWT.SYS,  the
    EPIXXCW2.SYS is Plug & Play compatible.


    1.J.2  Windows 2000 - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       Under  Windows 2000  frame  buffer memory must be allocated during Windows'
    initialization.

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    configuration  of  frame  buffer memory allocation.  The following information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

       The  requested  frame  buffer memory size must be specified in the Registry
    entry described above, using an entry named `PIXCI', such as:

             PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing the `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.   If  no
    frame  buffer  memory  size  is  specified, a default size of 32768 KiBytes is
    used.  Windows must be restarted for the new specification to take effect.

       Optionally,

             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is to be allocated in blocks or partitions of  the  stated  size.   Requesting
    memory  partitioned  into blocks may allow receiving more memory that would be
    available as a single block.  However, (a) Each  frame  buffer  must  be  com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems.  Systems with very high resolution cam-
    eras  using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully, so
    as to minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller than a frame buffer,  at










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    the end of each partition.

       For  the  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board frame buffer memory,
    memory reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer  (approximately
    1 MiByte)  and  optionally  for support of time stamping of captured frames as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of  frame  buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are needed for
    each frame buffer's capture status.

       Windows 2000 limits the maximum amount of allocatable frame buffer  memory,
    dependent  upon  what  other  devices are installed, the total computer memory
    size, and other factors.  Under Windows 2000, the  maximum  amount  of  memory
    that can be allocated by this method is typically limited to 64 or 92 MiByte.

       Windows  may  provide  less  frame buffer memory than was requested.  If no
    memory could be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not  be  available,
    stating  `Can't  allocate  frame  buffer memory'.  Otherwise, within XCAP, the
    number of available frame buffers can  be  checked  under  PIXCI(R),  PIXCI(R)
    Video  Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once during
    Windows initialization; the contents of frame buffers are retained as XCAP  is
    closed and restarted, but lost if Windows is restarted.


    1.J.3  Windows 2000 - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As  described above, frame buffer memory allocated by EPIXXCW2.SYS for Win-
    dows 2000, during Windows startup may be limited to a small percentage of  the
    computer memory size; typically 64 to 96 MiByte.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory recognized by Windows and then instructing EPIXXCW2.SYS  for  Windows 2000
    to explicitly use a section of memory without allocating it from Windows.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.   The  following
    information  allows  manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Edit C:\BOOT.INI, restricting Windows 2000 to use no  more  than  a  set
          amount  of  memory:  by  copying  an existing configuration line, adding
          /MAXMEM=XX (where XX is the memory size  in  MiByte)  and  changing  the
          prompt name.  For example, changing:

                   [operating systems]
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows 2000"

          to:

                   [operating systems]
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows 2000 [NT=64M PIXCI=256M]"  /MAXMEM=64
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows 2000"

          Do  not copy this new line as shown above; the first portion of the line










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          must be copied from an existing configuration line in  your  C:\BOOT.INI
          file.   The  text between quotes appears as a boot selection prompt, use
          of `[NT=64M PIXCI=256M]' is a suggested reminder, but not required.

             Also in C:\BOOT.INI, change the timeout selection to be greater  than
          0:

                   [boot loader]
                   timeout=30

          Otherwise the BOOT.INI configuration options will not be shown when Win-
          dows starts.

             Keeping the original configuration line, as a boot selection  option,
          is highly recommended as a backup.

             Under  Windows XP, the BOOTCFG command, provided with Windows, can be
          used to change the BOOT.INI file instead of manual editing.

      2.  Edit the registry entry:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCW2

          On the `PIXCI' field add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory  is
          partitioned  for  the  sake of virtual memory management: (a) Each frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies  that  the  entire image memory is to be handled as one parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating systems.  For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384 is suggested;
          though the value need not be a power of two.   Systems  with  very  high
          resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the partition
          size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller
          than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by  not
          mapping  the image memory directly into the application program's space.
          It may also be necessary to append:












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   -MU 0x03

          which additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only  on
          demand.

             Be  careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the specified
          /MAXMEM limit - including exact base2 to base10 conversions!  (i.e.  for
          /MAXMEM=64,  the  smallest  valid  value  of  -IA is 65536, not 64000!).
          Likewise, be certain that the -IA plus -IM  values  do  not  exceed  the
          amount of memory available!

             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory directly below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps  other  hardware
          resources  such  as  BIOS,  memory  mapped I/O, PCI configuration space,
          etc.[5]  and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use as
          frame buffers.  The usable frame buffer memory is therefore  reduced  by
          the  amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM size
          overlap the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte  address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between  the
          768 MiByte  and  1024 MiByte  addresses may be reserved; the -IA address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Restart Windows, using the newly added boot selection.

       For example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating  256 MiByte
    for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             /MAXMEM=256

    in C:\BOOT.INI, and use:

             PIXCI = -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  registry  entry.   Note  that  262144  is  256x1024,  and  786432  is
    (1024-256)x1024.

       Note that if this memory allocation method is used, program access to image
    data  may  be slower.  Thus, the video display rate (and image processing) may
    be slower, but the video capture  rate  (such  as  sequence  capture)  is  not
    adversely  affected.   This  method of memory allocation is primarily used for
    video rate acquisition of long sequences, followed  by  off-line  analysis  or
    saving of the sequence.

    1.J.4  Windows 2000 - Authorization Key - Manual Installation

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    installation of the authorization key's driver(s).

       The following information allows manual installation, correcting  problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures.


    1.J.4.a  Printer  Port  Authorization Keys.  Run the authorization key utility
    program provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -install

    or:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -help

    for additional options.

       The following information allows manual installation, correcting  problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures for the printer port version of autho-
    rization keys.

      1.  The file HARDLOCK.SYS must be copied  to  the  Windows  SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
          directory, typically:

                   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

      2.  Using  the  Registry  Editor  (REGEDIT) provided with Windows, create an
          entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HardLock

          This key must contain values:

                   ErrorControl  =  0x00000001
                   Group         =  "Extended Base"
                   Start         =  0x00000002
                   Type          =  0x00000001

          or, if using REGEDT32, the values should appear as:

                   ErrorControl:REG_DWORD:0x1
                   Group:REG_SZ:ExtendedBase
                   Start:REG_DWORD:0x2
                   Type:REG_DWORD:0x1












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


      3.  Shut down and restart Windows for  the  new  registry  entries  to  take
          effect.

      4.  If the authorization key is connected to a non-standard printer port, an
          additional entry may be required:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HardLock\Parameters

          which contains a value:

                   IoPortAddress0  = 0x????            (for REGEDIT)
                   IoPortAddress0:REG_DWORD:0x????     (for REGEDT32)

          where the `????'  is replaced with the parallel port's  I/O  address  in
          hexadecimal.  As before, Windows must be shut down and restarted.


    1.J.4.b  USB  Authorization Blue Keys.  Run the authorization key utility pro-
    gram provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -install

    or

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -help

    for additional options.  The  authorization  key's  vendor  does  not  provide
    detailed information regarding installation of drivers for USB port authoriza-
    tion keys.


    1.K  For Windows NT

       XCAP requires Windows NT Version 4 with Service Pack 3 or later.

       Administrator privileges are required to complete the  installation  proce-
    dure.

      1.  Install Files:

            a.  If XCAP is provided on a CD:

                  i.  If  your  computer  is set to allow automatic execution of a
                      loaded CD, the CD's interactive index program will  be  exe-
                      cuted  automatically.  Otherwise, execute the index program,
                      from a Command Prompt, or via the Windows `Start', `Run':













    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                               > Z:SETUP       (replace Z with drive letter for your CD/DVD)

                 ii.  Select `Setup PIXCI(R) Imaging Software' and  `XCAP  Imaging
                      Application for Windows NT/ME/98/95'.  Click `OK'.

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory  was  formerly  C:\XCAP  and  will  be reused when
                      updating a legacy installation.   The  default  installation
                      directory   for   new  installations  is  nominally  C:\Pro-
                      gram Files\EPIX\XCAP, but depends on  the  current  Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN9598MeNT.EXE

                      from the EPIX, Inc. ftp site.

                 ii.  Execute  the  downloaded  program, from a Command Prompt, or
                      via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                           > XCAPWIN9598MeNT.EXE

                iii.  Follow the installation program's  directions,  such  as  to
                      select  an installation directory.  The default installation
                      directory was formerly  C:\XCAP  and  will  be  reused  when
                      updating  a  legacy  installation.  The default installation
                      directory  for  new  installations  is   nominally   C:\Pro-
                      gram Files\EPIX\XCAP,  but  depends  on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

                 iv.  The downloaded .EXE file may be deleted.

            c.  The installation procedure creates a new program group, containing
                XCAP  and  several  .TXT  files.   The  *.TXT  files contain these
                installation instructions, a list of  distributed  files,  correc-
                tions  or  additions  to this manual, or other up-to-date informa-
                tion.  The PCITIPS.TXT file provides the PCI  Configuration  Tips,
                with  tips  for  resolving  hardware  and software conflicts.  The
                installation procedure also, optionally, creates a desktop  short-
                cut for XCAP.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with a printer port
                authorization key or an USB authorization key.  XCAP-Lite is  pro-
                vided with a software Activation ID Code.

                   The  printer  port authorization key is black and approximately
                the  size  and  shape  of  a  printer's  parallel  port  connector










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                (5.5x4.5x1.6 cm),  but  with  two 25-pin connectors.  If provided,
                connect the authorization key to any printer port.  If  a  printer
                cable  was  attached  to  the  printer port, reconnect the printer
                cable to the back of the authorization key; the authorization  key
                will not affect normal printer operation.

                   Do  not  connect the printer port authorization key to a 25-pin
                serial (RS-232) port, or to any other interface  that  happens  to
                use the same style connector; the authorization key will not func-
                tion, might be permanently damaged, and the warranty will be void!

                   The Blue authorization USB key has the size and shape of a  USB
                thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm), with a standard USB-A 4-pin connec-
                tor.  If provided, connect the authorization key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached, to the printer port
                or  USB port as appropriate, while XCAP is running.  If the autho-
                rization key is missing, or disconnected while  XCAP  is  running,
                then  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std or XCAP-Ltd, will behave similar to the
                XCAP-Lite version; selected image processing  and  analysis  tools
                will not be operational.

            b.  Upon  first  use,  XCAP  will  prompt for configuration as per the
                authorization key (including  installation  of  drivers),  or  the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently,  use Change Setup under Utilities - Program Setup
                within XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the  authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  may  be  installed by the
                PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant feature within XCAP.

                   Alternately,  the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  driver  can   be
                installed as follows.

            b.  Click  `Start', `Programs', and `Windows NT Explorer'.  Within the
                chosen  installation  directory  (typically  C:\XCAP  or   C:\Pro-
                gram Files\EPIX\XCAP),    find    and    highlight    file   Driv-
                ers\WinNT\EPIXXCWT.INF (or EPIXXCNT.INF for XCAP version  2.0  and
                earlier).   From  the  menu  bar,  select  `File'  and  `Install'.
                Restart Windows.

      4.  Configure Graphics Display:

            a.  A `High Color (16 bit or 65536 Color)', `True  Color  (24  bit  or
                16777216  Color)', or `True Color (32 bit)' setting for the graph-
                ics display is required for proper display of images  and  overlay
                graphics.   The  `True  Color (24 bit or 16777216 Color)' or `True
                Color (32 bit)' is suggested for higher quality, and quicker, dis-
                play  of  images and overlay graphics.  This may be checked and/or










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                modified via Windows `Start', `Settings', `Control  Panel',  `Dis-
                play', `Settings'.

            b.  Under  `Start', `Settings', `Control Panel', `Display', `Effects',
                the `Show window contents while dragging' must be disabled.

      5.  Restart Windows.

      6.  XCAP is now ready to run, by  clicking  the  optional  shortcut,  or  by
          clicking `Start', `Programs', `XCAP Imaging', and finally `XCAP for Win-
          dows'.



    1.L  Windows NT Esoterica



    1.L.1  Windows NT - Manual Installation

       Use of EPIXXCWT.INF (or EPIXXCNT.INF for version 2.0 and  earlier),  above,
    provides  automatic  installation of EPIXXCWT.SYS (or EPIXXCNT.SYS for version
    2.0 and earlier) in most circumstances.  The following information allows man-
    ual  installation,  correcting  problems,  or integration with an OEM's proce-
    dures.

      1.  The EPIXXCWT.SYS (or EPIXXCNT.SYS for version 2.0 and earlier)  must  be
          copied to the Windows SYSTEM32\DRIVERS directory, typically:

                   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

      2.  Using  the  Registry  Editor  (REGEDIT) provided with Windows, create an
          entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCWT  (version 2.1+)
                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCNT  (version 2.0-)

          This entry must contain:

                   ErrorControl  =  0x00000001
                   Group         =  "Extended base"
                   Start         =  0x00000001
                   Type          =  0x00000001

          and may, as described below, also contain:

                   PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

          Create an entry such as:














    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System\EPIXXCWT  (version 2.1+)
                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System\EPIXXCNT  (version 2.0-)

          This entry must contain:

                   EventMessageFile = "%SystemRoot%\System32\IoLogMsg.dll"
                   TypesSupported   = 0x00000007

      3.  Shut down and restart Windows.


    1.L.2  Windows NT - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       Under Windows NT, frame buffer memory must  be  allocated  during  Windows'
    initialization.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of frame buffer memory allocation.   The  following  information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

       The requested frame buffer memory size must be specified  in  the  Registry
    entry described above, using an entry named `PIXCI', such as:

             PIXCI         =  "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing  the  `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.  If no
    frame buffer memory size is specified, a  default  size  of  32768 KiBytes  is
    used.  Windows must be restarted for the new specification to take effect.

       Optionally,

             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is  to  be  allocated  in blocks or partitions of the stated size.  Requesting
    memory partitioned into blocks may allow receiving more memory that  would  be
    available  as  a  single  block.   However, (a) Each frame buffer must be com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems.  Systems with very high resolution cam-
    eras using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully,  so
    as  to minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller than a frame buffer, at
    the end of each partition.

       For the PIXCI(R) CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board  frame  buffer  memory,
    memory  reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer (approximately
    1 MiByte) and optionally for support of time stamping of  captured  frames  as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of frame buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are  needed  for
    each frame buffer's capture status.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       Windows NT  limits  the  maximum amount of allocatable frame buffer memory,
    dependent upon what other devices are installed,  the  total  computer  memory
    size,  and  other factors.  Using the Control Panel's Device Manager to select
    Boot or System priority startup for EPIXXCWT.SYS (or EPIXXCNT.SYS for  version
    2.0  and  earlier) allows more frame buffer memory to be allocated than selec-
    tion of Automatic startup.

       Windows may provide less frame buffer memory than  was  requested.   If  no
    memory  could  be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not be available,
    stating `Can't allocate frame buffer memory'.   Otherwise,  within  XCAP,  the
    number  of  available  frame  buffers  can be checked under PIXCI(R), PIXCI(R)
    Video Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once  during
    Windows  initialization; the contents of frame buffers are retained as XCAP is
    closed and restarted, but lost if Windows is restarted.


    1.L.3  Windows NT - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As described above, frame  buffer  memory  allocated  by  EPIXXCWT.SYS  (or
    EPIXXCNT.SYS  for  version 2.0 and earlier) during Windows startup may be lim-
    ited to a small percentage of the computer memory size.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory   recognized   by   Windows NT,  and  then  instructing  EPIXXCWT.SYS  (or
    EPIXXCNT.SYS for version 2.0 and earlier) to explicitly use a section of  mem-
    ory without allocating it from Windows.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.   The  following
    information  allows  manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Edit C:\BOOT.INI, restricting Windows NT to  use  no  more  than  a  set
          amount  of  memory:  by  copying  an existing configuration line, adding
          /MAXMEM=XX (where XX is the memory size  in  MiByte)  and  changing  the
          prompt name.  For example, changing:

                   [operating systems]
                   multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(7)\WINNT="Windows NT V 4.00"

          Do  not copy this new line as shown above; the first portion of the line
          must be copied from an existing configuration line in  your  C:\BOOT.INI
          file.   The  text between quotes appears as a boot selection prompt, use
          of `[NT=64M PIXCI=256M]' is a suggested reminder, but not required.

             Also in C:\BOOT.INI, change the timeout selection to be greater  than
          0:










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   [boot loader]
                   timeout=30

          Otherwise the BOOT.INI configuration options will not be shown when Win-
          dows starts.

             Keeping the original configuration line, as a boot selection  option,
          is highly recommended as a backup.

      2.  Edit the registry entry:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCWT  (version 2.1+)
                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EPIXXCNT  (version 2.0-)

          On the `PIXCI' field add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The  -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory is
          partitioned for the sake of virtual memory  management:  (a) Each  frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies that the entire image memory is to be handled  as  one  parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating systems.  For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384 is suggested;
          though  the  value  need  not be a power of two.  Systems with very high
          resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the partition
          size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller
          than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to  the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by not
          mapping the image memory directly into the application program's  space.
          It may also be necessary to append:

                   -MU 0x03

          which  additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only on
          demand.

             Be careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the  specified
          /MAXMEM  limit - including exact base2 to base10 conversions!  (i.e. for
          /MAXMEM=64, the smallest valid value  of  -IA  is  65536,  not  64000!).
          Likewise,  be  certain  that  the  -IA plus -IM values do not exceed the
          amount of memory available!










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory  directly  below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps other hardware
          resources such as BIOS, memory  mapped  I/O,  PCI  configuration  space,
          etc.[6] and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use  as
          frame  buffers.   The usable frame buffer memory is therefore reduced by
          the amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM  size
          overlap  the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On  computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between the
          768 MiByte and 1024 MiByte addresses may be reserved;  the  -IA  address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Restart Windows, using the newly added boot selection.

       For  example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating 256 MiByte
    for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             /MAXMEM=256

    in C:\BOOT.INI, and use:

             PIXCI = -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  registry  entry.   Note  that  262144  is  256x1024,  and  786432  is
    (1024-256)x1024.

       Note that if this memory allocation method is used, program access to image
    data may be slower.  Thus, the video display rate (and image  processing)  may
    be  slower,  but  the  video  capture  rate  (such as sequence capture) is not
    adversely affected.  This method of memory allocation is  primarily  used  for
    video  rate  acquisition  of  long sequences, followed by off-line analysis or
    saving of the sequence.

    1.L.4.a  Printer Port Authorization Keys.  Run the authorization  key  utility
    program provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -install

    or:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -help

    for additional options.

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures for the printer port version of autho-
    rization keys.

      1.  The  file  HARDLOCK.SYS  must  be copied to the Windows SYSTEM32\DRIVERS
          directory, typically:

                   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS

      2.  The file HLVDD.DLL must copied to the Windows  SYSTEM  directory,  typi-
          cally:

                   C:\WINNT\SYSTEM

          or placed within the XCAP installation directory, typically:

                   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP\PROGRAM

      3.  Using  the  Registry  Editor  (REGEDIT) provided with Windows, create an
          entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HardLock

          This key must contain values:

                   ErrorControl  =  0x00000001
                   Group         =  "Extended Base"
                   Start         =  0x00000002
                   Type          =  0x00000001

          or, if using REGEDT32, the values should appear as:

                   ErrorControl:REG_DWORD:0x1
                   Group:REG_SZ:ExtendedBase
                   Start:REG_DWORD:0x2
                   Type:REG_DWORD:0x1












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


      4.  Shut down and restart Windows for  the  new  registry  entries  to  take
          effect.

      5.  If the authorization key is connected to a non-standard printer port, an
          additional entry may be required:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HardLock\Parameters

          which contains a value:

                   IoPortAddress0  = 0x????            (for REGEDIT)
                   IoPortAddress0:REG_DWORD:0x????     (for REGEDT32)

          where the `????'  is replaced with the parallel port's  I/O  address  in
          hexadecimal.  As before, Windows must be shut down and restarted.


    1.L.4.b  USB  Authorization Blue Keys.  Run the authorization key utility pro-
    gram provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -install

    or

             HARDLOCK\WinXP+\HASPDINST -help

    for additional options.  The  authorization  key's  vendor  does  not  provide
    detailed information regarding installation of drivers for USB port authoriza-
    tion keys.


    1.M  For Windows 95, 98, ME

      1.  Install Files:

            a.  If XCAP is provided on a CD:

                  i.  If your computer is set to allow automatic  execution  of  a
                      loaded  CD,  the CD's interactive index program will be exe-
                      cuted automatically.  Otherwise, execute the index  program,
                      from a Command Prompt, or via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                               > Z:SETUP       (replace Z with drive letter for your CD/DVD)

                 ii.  Select  `Setup  PIXCI(R) Imaging Software' and `XCAP Imaging
                      Application for Windows NT/ME/98/95'.  Click `OK'.

                iii.  Follow the installation program's  directions,  such  as  to
                      select  an installation directory.  The default installation










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                      directory was formerly  C:\XCAP  and  will  be  reused  when
                      updating  a  legacy  installation.  The default installation
                      directory  for  new  installations  is   nominally   C:\Pro-
                      gram Files\EPIX\XCAP,  but  depends  on the current Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/XCAPWIN9598MeNT.EXE

                      from the EPIX, Inc. ftp site.

                 ii.  Execute the downloaded program, from a  Command  Prompt,  or
                      via the Windows `Start', `Run':

                           > XCAPWIN9598MeNT.EXE

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory  was  formerly  C:\XCAP  and  will  be reused when
                      updating a legacy installation.   The  default  installation
                      directory   for   new  installations  is  nominally  C:\Pro-
                      gram Files\EPIX\XCAP, but depends on  the  current  Windows'
                      CSIDL settings.

                 iv.  The downloaded .EXE file may be deleted.

            c.  The installation procedure creates a new program group, containing
                XCAP and several  .TXT  files.   The  *.TXT  files  contain  these
                installation  instructions,  a  list of distributed files, correc-
                tions or additions to this manual, or  other  up-to-date  informa-
                tion.   The  PCITIPS.TXT file provides the PCI Configuration Tips,
                with tips for resolving  hardware  and  software  conflicts.   The
                installation  procedure also, optionally, creates a desktop short-
                cut for XCAP.

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with a printer port
                authorization  key or an USB authorization key.  XCAP-Lite is pro-
                vided with a software Activation ID Code.

                   The printer port authorization key is black  and  approximately
                the  size  and  shape  of  a  printer's  parallel  port  connector
                (5.5x4.5x1.6 cm), but with two 25-pin  connectors.   If  provided,
                connect  the  authorization key to any printer port.  If a printer
                cable was attached to the  printer  port,  reconnect  the  printer
                cable  to the back of the authorization key; the authorization key
                will not affect normal printer operation.












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                   Do not connect the printer port authorization key to  a  25-pin
                serial  (RS-232)  port,  or to any other interface that happens to
                use the same style connector; the authorization key will not func-
                tion, might be permanently damaged, and the warranty will be void!

                   The  Blue authorization USB key has the size and shape of a USB
                thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm), with a standard USB-A 4-pin connec-
                tor.  If provided, connect the authorization key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached, to the printer port
                or USB port as appropriate, while XCAP is running.  If the  autho-
                rization  key  is  missing, or disconnected while XCAP is running,
                then XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std or XCAP-Ltd, will behave similar  to  the
                XCAP-Lite  version;  selected  image processing and analysis tools
                will not be operational.

            b.  Upon first use, XCAP will prompt  for  configuration  as  per  the
                authorization  key  (including  installation  of  drivers), or the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently, use Change Setup under Utilities - Program  Setup
                within  XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  Under Windows 95, 98, and ME, the Windows' Device Manager must  be
                used for initial installation of the PIXCI(R) driver.

                   If the PIXCI(R) frame grabber was not previously installed, the
                first time Windows starts after installation of the PIXCI(R) frame
                grabber, Windows will notice the new device and inquire.

                   The  first  time  Windows  95  starts after installation of the
                PIXCI(R) frame grabber,  a  window  titled  `New  Hardware  Found'
                appears;  select  `Driver  from disk provided by hardware manufac-
                turer', click `OK'.  A window stating  `Insert  the  manufacturers
                installation  disk  ...',  `Copy  manufacturers  files  from  ...'
                appears; click `Browse' enter path Drivers\Win95\EPIXXCW5.INF  (or
                EPIXXC32.INF  for  XCAP version 2.0 and earlier) within the chosen
                installation   directory    (typically    C:\XCAP    or    C:\Pro-
                gram Files\EPIX\XCAP),  and  click  `OK', `OK'.  Do not accept the
                offer to `Reboot'; a full shutdown and reboot is  required.   Some
                later  releases  of  Windows  95 behave similar to Windows 98; the
                inquiries and responses may instead follow the steps below.

                   The first time Windows 98  starts  after  installation  of  the
                PIXCI(R)  frame grabber, a pop-up window with the message `New PCI
                Multimedia Device' will  flash.   A  window  stating  `The  wizard
                searches  for new driver for PCI Multimedia Video Device' appears;
                click `Next', select `Search for the best driver for your device',
                click  `Next'.   A  window  stating  `Windows  will search for new
                driver  ...'   and  `Specify   Location'   appears;   enter   path










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                Drivers\Win98\EPIXXCW5.INF  (or  EPIXXC32.INF for XCAP version 2.0
                and earlier) within the chosen installation  directory  (typically
                C:\XCAP  or C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP), and click `Next'.  A win-
                dow  reports  that  a   driver   was   found,   namely   ...\Driv-
                ers\Win98\EPIXXCW5.INF, click `Next' and `Finish'.

                   The  first  time  Windows  ME  starts after installation of the
                PIXCI(R) frame grabber, a pop-up window with the message `New  PCI
                Multimedia  Device'  will  flash.   A  window stating `Windows has
                found the following new hardware:  PCI  Multimedia  Video  Device'
                appears;  select  `Specify the location of the driver (Advanced)',
                click `Next', select `Search for the best driver for your device',
                check  box  `Specify  a Location', Enter path Drivers\WinME within
                the chosen installation directory (typically  C:\XCAP  or  C:\Pro-
                gram Files\EPIX\XCAP),  and click `Next'.  A window reports that a
                driver was  found,  namely  ...\Drivers\WinME\EPIXXCW5.INF,  click
                `Next' and `Finish'.

                   If  the PIXCI(R) frame grabber was already installed under Win-
                dows 95 or 98, and `Cancel' was clicked when Windows  started  and
                announced  the  presence  of  new  `PCI Multimedia Hardware', then
                instruct Windows to load the appropriate driver.   Click  `Start',

                and click `OK'.

                   If the PIXCI(R) frame grabber was already installed under  Win-

                announced the presence of  new  `PCI  Multimedia  Hardware',  then
                instruct  Windows  to load the appropriate driver.  Click `Start',
                `Settings', `Control Panel', `System' (if `System' is not  listed,
                click  on  `View all Control Panel options'), `Device Manager' and

                bar, select `File' and `Install'.  Restart Windows.

      4.  Set Frame Buffer Memory Size (optional):

            a.  By default, 4 MiBytes of frame buffer memory is allocated.

                   Under Windows 95, 98, and ME, frame buffer memory must be allo-
                cated during Windows' initialization, as specified in the Windows'
                SYSTEM.INI file.

                   Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides
                convenient  configuration  of frame buffer memory allocation.  The
                following  information  allows  manual  configuration,  correcting
                problems, or integration with an OEM's procedures.

            b.  If  additional  frame buffer memory is desired, then at the end of
                the Windows' SYSTEM.INI file, add a section:

                         [EPIX_XC]
                         PIXCI=-IM <memorysize>

                replacing the `<memorysize>'  with  the  desired  memory  size  in
                KiBytes.   Windows  must be restarted for the new specification to
                take effect.

                   Windows 95, 98, and ME limits the maximum amount of allocatable
                frame  buffer  memory,  dependent  upon  what  other  devices  are
                installed, the total computer memory size, and other factors.

                   Windows  may  provide  less  frame  buffer  memory   than   was
                requested.   If  no  memory could be allocated, the PIXCI(R) frame
                grabber will not be usable; reporting `Can't allocate frame buffer
                memory'.   Otherwise, within XCAP, the amount of frame buffer mem-
                ory can be checked under PIXCI(R), PIXCI(R) Open/Close.

      5.  Configure Graphics Display:

            a.  A `High Color (16 bit or 65536 Color)', `True  Color  (24  bit  or
                16777216  Color)', or `True Color (32 bit)' setting for the graph-
                ics display system is required for proper display  of  images  and
                overlay  graphics.  The `True Color (24 bit or 16777216 Color)' or
                `True Color  (32  bit)'  is  suggested  for  higher  quality,  and
                quicker,  display  of  images  and  overlay graphics.  This may be
                checked and/or modified  via  Windows  `Start',  `Control  Panel',
                `Display', `Settings'.

            b.  In  Windows 95,  under  `Control  Panel',  `Display', `Plus!', the
                `Show window contents while dragging' must be disabled (this  fea-
                ture  is not present in older versions of Windows 95).  Or in Win-
                dows 98/ME, under `Control Panel', `Display', `Effects', the `Show
                window contents while dragging' must be disabled.












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


            c.  After  changing  the  settings  a  full  shutdown and CTRL+ALT+DEL
                reboot should be used.  The quick restart offered  by  older  ver-
                sions  of  Windows 95, and the `hot' graphics display reconfigura-
                tion performed by newer versions of Windows 95,  may  not  re-ini-
                tialize all devices properly.

      6.  Restart Windows.

      7.  XCAP  is  now  ready  to  run,  by clicking the optional shortcut, or by
          clicking `Start', `Programs', `XCAP Imaging', and finally `XCAP'.

    1.N.1  Windows 95, 98, ME - Manual Installation

       Use of EPIXXCW5.INF (or EPIXXC32.VXD for version 2.0 and  earlier),  above,
    provides  automatic  installation of EPIXXCW5.VXD (or EPIXXC32.VXD for version
    2.0 and earlier) in most circumstances.  The following information allows man-
    ual  installation,  correcting  problems,  or integration with an OEM's proce-
    dures.

      1.  The EPIXXCW5.VXD (or EPIXXC32.VXD for version 2.0 and earlier)  must  be
          copied to the Windows SYSTEM directory, typically:

                   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM

      2.  Using  the  Registry  Editor  (REGEDIT) provided with Windows, create an
          entry such as:

                   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Unknown\0000

          replacing the \0000, if such an entry  already  exists,  with  the  next
          available sequential number.  This entry must contain:

                   DevLoader=      "epixxc32.vxd"                      (for version 2.0-)
                   DevLoader=      "epixxcw5.vxd"                      (for version 2.1+)
                   DriverDesc=     "PIXCI(R) PCI Video Capture Board"  (optional)
                   InfSection=     "Unknown"
                   StaticVxD=      "epixxc32.vxd"                      (for version 2.0-)
                   StaticVxD=      "epixxcw5.vxd"                      (for version 2.1+)

      3.  Using  the  Registry Editor, edit the existing entry for PIXCI(R) SV2 or
          PIXCI(R) SV3:

    1.N.2  Windows 95, 98 - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As described above, frame  buffer  memory  allocated  by  EPIXXCW5.VXD  (or
    EPIXXC32.VXD for version 2.0 and earlier) during Windows startup is limited to
    a small percentage of total computer memory.

       A larger frame buffer memory can often  be  obtained  by  reserving  memory
    before Windows starts.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.   The  following
    information  allows  manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  In C:\CONFIG.SYS, add a line:[8]

                   DEVICE=C:\XCAP\Drivers\Win95\EPIXXC.SYS -IM <framebuffermemorysize>

          or

                   DEVICE=C:\XCAP\Drivers\Win95\EPIXXC.SYS -OS <reservememorysize>

          after  DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS,  replacing  `<framebuffermemorysize>'  with the
          desired frame buffer memory size, in KiBytes.  Alternately,  the  second
          form  reserves  `<reservememorysize>' KiBytes, for Windows and allocates
          (almost) all of the remaining memory for use as frame buffer memory.

      2.  Edit the Windows' SYSTEM.INI file, add a section:

                   [EPIX_XC]
                   PIXCI=-IM 0

          so that EPIXXCW5.VXD (or  EPIXXC32.VXD  for  version  2.0  and  earlier)
          doesn't reserve and then waste additional frame buffer memory.

      3.  Restart Windows.

       This technique allows most of the computer's memory to be reserved as frame
    buffer memory (e.g. typically all but 8 or 16 MiBytes,  as  required  by  Win-
    dows).   However, the memory is unavailable to Windows, even when the PIXCI(R)

     8. If the computer is configured with a selective boot option (i.e. so as to
        boot Windows or boot old DOS), be sure to modify the correct CONFIG.SYS.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    frame grabber's driver is not open.

       If the specified amount of frame buffer  memory  could  not  be  allocated,
    EPIXXC.SYS  will  attempt  to  allocate  smaller amounts.  If no memory can be
    allocated EPIXXC.SYS, will display an error message  during  Windows  startup,
    and  the PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not be available, stating `Can't allocate
    frame buffer memory'.

       This alternate frame buffer allocation method is not available  under  Win-
    dows ME.


    1.N.3  Windows ME - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As  described  above,  frame buffer memory allocated by EPIXXCW5.VXD during
    Windows startup is limited to a small percentage of total computer memory.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory  recognized by Windows ME, and then instructing EPIXXCW5.VXD to explicitly
    use a section of memory without allocating it from Windows.

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    configuration  of  forceful  frame  buffer  memory  allocation.  The following
    information allows manual configuration, correcting problems,  or  integration
    with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Restrict  Windows  to  use no more than a set amount of memory: Edit the
          Windows' SYSTEM.INI file, add or modify the MaxPhysPage entry,  specify-
          ing  the maximum amount of memory to be used by Windows in units of 4096
          byte pages, expressed in hexadecimal:

                   [386Enh]
                   MaxPhysPage=4000    ;; 64 MiByte in 4096 byte pages, in hexadecimal

      2.  Edit the Windows' SYSTEM.INI file, add a section and entry:

                   [EPIX_XC]
                   PIXCI= -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                          -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                          -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all three fields are on the same line.

             The -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory  is
          partitioned  for  the  sake of virtual memory management: (a) Each frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies  that  the  entire image memory is to be handled as one parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating systems.  For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384 is suggested;
          though the value need not be a power of two.   Systems  with  very  high
          resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the partition
          size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller
          than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             When using more than 1 or 2 GiBytes of image memory, it may be neces-
          sary to append:

                   -MU 0x01

          to the `PIXCI' field, conserving system memory mapping resources by  not
          mapping  the image memory directly into the application program's space.
          It may also be necessary to append:

                   -MU 0x03

          which additionally conserves system resources by mapping memory only  on
          demand.

             Be  careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the specified
          /MaxPhysPage limit - including exact base2 to base10 conversions!  (i.e.
          for  MaxPhysPage=4000  or  64 MiByte, the smallest valid value of -IA is
          65536, not 64000!).  Likewise, be certain that the -IA plus  -IM  values
          do not exceed the amount of memory available!

      3.  Restart Windows.

       For  example,  for  a  computer  with  256 MiByte of memory, allocating 192
    MiByte for Windows and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             MaxPhysPage=C000

    and

             PIXCI = -IA 196608 -IM 65536 -MB 16384



    1.N.4  Windows 95, 98, ME - Authorization Key - Manual Installation

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    installation of the authorization key's driver(s).

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures.


    1.N.4.a  Printer Port Authorization Keys.  Run the authorization  key  utility
    program provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\Win95+\HLDINST.EXE -install

    or:











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             HARDLOCK\Win95+\HLDINST.EXE -help

    for additional options.

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,
    or integration with an OEM's procedures for the printer port version of autho-
    rization keys.

      1.  The  file  HARDLOCK.VXD  must be copied to the Windows SYSTEM directory,
          typically:

                   C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM

          or placed within the XCAP installation directory, typically:

                   C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP\PROGRAM

    Normally, all LPT ports are scanned for the authorization key.   Should  other
    hardware use, or overlap, one of the LPT I/O port addresses, the search may be
    restricted to specific I/O ports.  In AUTOEXEC.BAT, specifying:

             SET HL_SEARCH=378p
             SET HL_SEARCH=278p,378p

    forces only the I/O port addresses listed (in  hexadecimal)  to  be  searched.
    Note  that  setting  HL_SEARCH from a DOS box has no effect, as the setting is
    not `carried back' from DOS into the Windows 95, 98, or ME environment.


    1.N.4.b  USB Authorization Blue Keys.  Run the authorization key utility  pro-
    gram provided with XCAP from the chosen installation directory:

             > C:\Program Files\EPIX\XCAP

    as:

             HARDLOCK\Win95+\HLDINST.EXE -install

    or

             HARDLOCK\Win95+\HLDINST.EXE -help

    for  additional  options.   The  authorization  key's  vendor does not provide
    detailed information regarding installation of drivers for USB port authoriza-
    tion keys.

    1.O  For Linux

       Super user privileges are required to complete the installation procedure.

      1.  Install Files:

            a.  If XCAP is provided on a CD or DVD:

                  i.  Assuming the CD/DVD has already been mounted, execute:

                           /media/.../PIXCI(R)/XCAP/xcaplnx_i386.bin

                      for 32-bit Linux, or:

                           /media/.../PIXCI(R)/XCAP/xcaplnx_x86_64.bin

                      for  64-bit  Linux.   Some  systems  mount  the CD/DVD under
                      /mnt/cdrom instead of /media/{loginname}.

                 ii.  Follow the installation program's  directions,  such  as  to
                      select  an installation directory.  The default installation
                      directory is /usr/local/xcap, or  /usr/local/xcap32  for  32
                      bit XCAP on an x86-64 platform.

            b.  If XCAP is provided via the internet:

                  i.  Download:

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/xcaplnx_i386.bin

                      for 32-bit Linux and Intel i386; or

                           ftp.epixinc.com/software/xcap_v38/xcaplnx_x86_64.bin

                      for 64-bit Linux and Intel x86-64; or

                 ii.  From a `terminal', change the downloaded program's mode:











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                               chmod a+x xcaplnx_i386.bin
                               chmod a+x xcaplnx_x86_64.bin
                               chmod a+x xcaplnx_armv7l.bin
                               chmod a+x xcaplnx_aarch64.bin

                      and execute the downloaded program:

                               ./xcaplnx_i386.bin
                               ./xcaplnx_x86_64.bin
                               ./xcaplnx_armv7l.bin
                               ./xcaplnx_aarch64.bin

                iii.  Follow  the  installation  program's  directions, such as to
                      select an installation directory.  The default  installation
                      directory  is  /usr/local/xcap,  or /usr/local/xcap32 for 32
                      bit XCAP on an x86-64 platform.

                 iv.  The downloaded .bin file may be deleted.

            c.  The installation procedure creates a `stub' to start XCAP  in  one
                of the /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, or /bin directories, which should
                already be in the user's execution `PATH'.  Several .txt files are
                installed  under  help  in  the  installation directory containing
                these installation instructions, a list of distributed files, cor-
                rections or additions to this manual, or other up-to-date informa-
                tion.  The pcitips.txt file provides the PCI  Configuration  Tips,
                with tips for resolving hardware and software conflicts.

            d.  The  installation  procedure  also,  optionally, creates a desktop
                shortcut for XCAP.  On some versions of Linux, the desktop manager
                may  not  show  the  shortcut  created by the installer; using the
                Linux file browser,  find,  copy,  and  paste  /usr/share/applica-
                tions/xcap.desktop onto the desktop.

            e.  For  Intel i386 and x86-64 platforms, XCAP includes a Java Runtime
                Environment (JRE) and can use either the included JRE  or  a  pre-
                installed JRE.

                   For  other platforms, XCAP expects a JRE to have been installed
                from the Linux distribution.  Typically, using:

                         apt-get update
                         apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

      2.  Install Authorization Key (for XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd):

            a.  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd are provided with a printer port
                authorization key or an USB authorization key.  XCAP-Lite is  pro-
                vided with a software Activation ID Code.

                   The  printer  port authorization key is black and approximately
                the  size  and  shape  of  a  printer's  parallel  port  connector
                (5.5x4.5x1.6 cm),  but  with  two 25-pin connectors.  If provided,
                connect the authorization key to any printer port.  If  a  printer
                cable  was  attached  to  the  printer port, reconnect the printer
                cable to the back of the authorization key; the authorization  key
                will not affect normal printer operation.

                   Do  not  connect the printer port authorization key to a 25-pin
                serial (RS-232) port, or to any other interface  that  happens  to
                use the same style connector; the authorization key will not func-
                tion, might be permanently damaged, and the warranty will be void!

                   The Blue (older) or Green (newer) authorization USB key has the
                size  and  shape  of  a  USB thumb drive (4to6x1.6x0.8 cm), with a
                standard USB-A 4-pin connector.  If provided, connect  the  autho-
                rization key to a USB port.

                   The authorization key must remain attached, to the printer port
                or USB port as appropriate, while XCAP is running.  If the  autho-
                rization  key  is  missing, or disconnected while XCAP is running,
                then XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std or XCAP-Ltd, will behave similar  to  the
                XCAP-Lite  version;  selected  image processing and analysis tools
                will not be operational.

                   XCAP and its printer port authorization  key  is  supported  on
                Intel  i386 platforms.  XCAP and its Blue USB authorization key is
                supported on Intel i386 and x86-64 platforms.  XCAP and its  Green










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


                USB authorization key are supported on Intel i386 and x86-64 plat-
                forms as well as ARM aarch64 and armv7l platforms.

            b.  Upon first use, XCAP will prompt  for  configuration  as  per  the
                authorization  key  (including  installation  of  drivers), or the
                software Activation ID Code.

                   Subsequently, use Change Setup under Utilities - Program  Setup
                within  XCAP, to change XCAP's configuration as per the authoriza-
                tion key or the software Activation ID Code.

      3.  Install PIXCI(R) Frame Grabber Driver:

            a.  The PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant within XCAP,  provides  convenient
                installation of the PIXCI(R) driver.

      4.  Configure Graphics Display:

            a.  Configuring the graphics display to TrueColor or DirectColor modes
                (using XWindows terminology), or to 24  or  32  bit  modes  (using
                graphic  display  hardware  terminology)  is  suggested for higher
                quality, and quicker display of images and overlay graphics.

                   Within XCAP, the current graphics display configuration can  be
                checked under Utility, Linux Info, X11.

      5.  XCAP  is  now  ready  to run, by executing[9] `xcap', or by clicking the
          optional shortcut.

    1.P.2  Linux 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x - Manual Installation

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  -  Driver Assistant within XCAP provides convenient
    installation of the:

             pixci_i386.ko        (32 bit driver for Intel i386)
             pixci_x86_64.ko      (64 bit driver for Intel x86-64
             pixci_armv7l.ko      (32 bit driver for ARM armv7l)
             pixci_aarch64.ko     (64 bit driver for ARM aarch64)

    drivers in  most  circumstances.   The  following  information  allows  manual
    installation, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's procedures.

      1.  Use pixci.sh (and the pixci.rc implied by pixci.sh) files to install the
          required    pixci_i386.ko,    pixci_x86_64.ko,    pixci_armv7l.ko,    or
          pixci_aarch64.ko  driver,  configuring  Linux  to automatically load the
          driver upon execution and during subsequent reboots:

                   pixci.sh install
                            <absolute path of directory containing pixci.rc>
                            <absolute path of directory containing pixci*.ko>

          The pixci.rc loads pixci_i386.ko, pixci_x86_64.ko,  pixci_armv7l.ko,  or
          pixci_aarch64.ko   with   Driver  Configuration  Parameters  taken  from
          /etc/default/pixci (re-read each time the driver is loaded).

      2.  Optionally, for Linux `tty' style access to the serial ports  of  Camera
          Link  compatible  PIXCI(R) cards from third party applications, the pix-
          citty_i386.ko,   pixcitty_x86_64.ko,   pixcitty_armv7l.ko,    or    pix-
          citty_aarch64.ko drivers can be installed with:

                   pixcitty.sh install
                               <absolute path of directory containing pixcitty.rc>
                               <absolute path of directory containing pixcitty*.ko>

          and its implied pixcitty.rc.

             The  optional  pixcitty_*.ko  is  NOT needed for access to the Camera
          Link serial port via XCLIB's proprietary API, nor is it needed by XCAP.

      3.  Optionally, for Linux `Video for Linux (V4L2)' style access to the video
          from third party applications, the pixciv4l_i386.ko, pixciv4l_x86_64.ko,
          pixciv4l_armv7l.ko, or  pixciv4l_aarch64.ko  drivers  can  be  installed
          with:

                   pixciv4l.sh install
                               <absolute path of directory containing pixciv4l.rc>
                               <absolute path of directory containing pixciv4l*.ko>

          and  its implied pixciv4l.rc, with `V4L2' configuration parameters taken
          from /etc/default/pixciv4l (re-read each time the driver is loaded).












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             The optional pixciv4l_*.ko is  NOT  needed  for  access  to  captured
          images or video via XCLIB's proprietary API, nor is it needed by XCAP.

       In  some  circumstances,  it  may be necessary to avoid use of pixci.sh and
    pixci.rc (and the implied use of Linux' /etc/rc for automatically  loading  of
    drivers during boot), and instead manually load the driver when needed.

      1.  Run, as appropriate:

                   insmod pixci_i386.ko    [ "PIXCIPARM=<driver_config_parameters>" ]
                   insmod pixci_x86_64.ko  [ "PIXCIPARM=<driver_config_parameters>" ]
                   insmod pixci_armv7l.ko  [ "PIXCIPARM=<driver_config_parameters>" ]
                   insmod pixci_aarch64.ko [ "PIXCIPARM=<driver_config_parameters>" ]

          using PIXCIPARM= to specify any optional Driver Configuration Parameters
          described below.  For example:

                   insmod pixci_i386.ko    "PIXCIPARM=-IM 8192 -DM 1"
                   insmod pixci_x86_64.ko  "PIXCIPARM=-IM 8192 -DM 1"
                   insmod pixci_armv7l.ko  "PIXCIPARM=-IM 8192 -DM 1"
                   insmod pixci_aarch64.ko "PIXCIPARM=-IM 8192 -DM 1"

          Some versions of insmod do not accept quoted spaces in the  Driver  Con-
          figuration  Parameters; an underscore (i.e.  `_') may be used instead of
          a space.  For example:

                   insmod pixci_i386.ko PIXCIPARM=-IM_8192_-DM_1

             To use the Driver Configuration Parameters  as  last  set  by  XCAP's
          Driver Assistant and stored in /etc/default/pixci:

                   insmod pixci_i386.ko PIXCIPARM=$(grep pixci.driver.parm= < /etc/default/pixci | sed -e "s/driver.pixci.parm=//"  -e "y/ \\\/__/")

      2.  Run:

                   cat /proc/devices

          and  note  the  major device number which is assigned to the pixci block
          device.  Run:

                   rm -f /dev/pixci
                   mknod /dev/pixci c <major_device_number> 0
                   chmod 666 /dev/pixci

          If embedding these commands into a shell script:

                   rm -f /dev/pixci
                   mknod /dev/pixci c $(awk "\\$2==\"PIXCI(R)\" {print \\$1}" /proc/devices) 0
                   chmod 666 /dev/pixci

          automatically `reads' and incorporates the major device number.












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


      3.  Optionally, for Linux `tty' style access to the serial ports  of  Camera
          Link compatible PIXCI(R) cards run, as appropriate:

                   insmod pixcitty_i386.ko      [ <tty_config_parameters> ]
                   insmod pixcitty_x86_64.ko    [ <tty_config_parameters> ]
                   insmod pixcitty_armv7l.ko    [ <tty_config_parameters> ]
                   insmod pixcitty_aarch64.ko   [ <tty_config_parameters> ]

          The

                   /dev/ttySPIXCI0
                   /dev/ttySPIXCI1
                   ...

          nodes for the first, second, etc. cards are created automatically.

             The `tty' configuration parameters are described in pixcitty.df.  For
          example:

                   insmod pixcitty_i386.ko      DEFAULT_BAUDRATE=9600
                   insmod pixcitty_x86_64.ko    DEFAULT_BAUDRATE=9600
                   insmod pixcitty_armv7l.ko    DEFAULT_BAUDRATE=9600
                   insmod pixcitty_aarch64.ko   DEFAULT_BAUDRATE=9600

             The optional  pixcitty_*.ko  driver  is  used  in  addition  to,  and
          installed after, the corresponding pixci_*.ko driver.  The optional pix-
          citty_*.ko is NOT needed for access to the Camera Link serial  port  via
          XCLIB's proprietary API, nor is it needed by XCAP.

      4.  Optionally,  for `Video for Linux (V4L2)' style access to the video from
          third party applications, run, as appropriate:

                   insmod pixciv4l_i386.ko      [ <v4l_config_parameters> ]
                   insmod pixciv4l_x86_64.ko    [ <v4l_config_parameters> ]
                   insmod pixciv4l_armv7l.ko    [ <v4l_config_parameters> ]
                   insmod pixciv4l_aarch64.ko   [ <v4l_config_parameters> ]

          The:

                   /dev/video*
                   ...

          nodes for the first, second, etc. cards are created automatically.

             The `V4L2' configuration parameters  are  described  in  pixciv4l.df.
          For example:

                   insmod pixciv4l_i386.ko      STREAM_MODE=1  STREAM_BUFFERS=12
                   insmod pixciv4l_x86_64.ko    STREAM_MODE=1  STREAM_BUFFERS=12
                   insmod pixciv4l_armv7l.ko    STREAM_MODE=1  STREAM_BUFFERS=12
                   insmod pixciv4l_aarch64.ko   STREAM_MODE=1  STREAM_BUFFERS=12












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             The  optional  pixciv4l_*.ko  driver  is  used  in  addition  to, and
          installed after, the corresponding pixci_*.ko driver.  The optional pix-
          civ4l_*.ko  is  NOT  needed  for  access to captured images or video via
          XCLIB's proprietary API, nor is it needed by XCAP.

      5.  For PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4, SV5, SV5A, SV5B, and  SV5L  frame  grabbers,
          drivers  other than those provided by EPIX, Inc. may have been installed
          during  Linux's  configuration.   See  http://will.freehosting.net/bttv-
          HOWTO.html,  section  5.1  for  information on removing the drivers.  In
          brief, use:

                   lsmod

          for a list of currently installed modules and remove any named videodev,
          i2c, i2c-char, tuner, msp3400, bt878, or bttv by using rmmod.


    1.P.3  Linux 2.4.x, 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x - Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

    Under Linux, frame buffer memory must be allocated during the driver's instal-
    lation.

       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    configuration  of  frame  buffer memory allocation.  The following information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

       The requested frame buffer memory size must be specified in the Driver Con-
    figuration Parameters, described above, using parameter

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    replacing the `<memorysize>' with the desired memory size in KiBytes.   If  no
    frame  buffer memory size is specified, a default size of 4096 KiBytes is used
    under 32 bit Linux.  32768 KiBytes is used under 64 bit Linux.

       Optionally,

             "-MB <memory_partition_size>"

    specifies that the requested

             "-IM <memorysize>"

    is to be allocated in blocks or partitions of  the  stated  size.   Requesting
    memory  partitioned  into blocks may allow receiving more memory that would be
    available as a single block.  However, (a) Each  frame  buffer  must  be  com-
    pletely contained within a partition, and (b) The maximum number of partitions
    is 256 under 32 bit operating systems, the maximum number of partitions is 256
    under  64  bit  operating  systems.  Systems with very high resolution cameras
    using large frame buffers should choose the partition size carefully, so as to
    minimize  the  unusable  memory remaining, smaller than a frame buffer, at the
    end of each partition.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       For the PIXCI(R) CL3SD and SI2, which have on-board  frame  buffer  memory,
    memory  reserved by the -IM parameter is needed as a DMA buffer (approximately
    1 MiByte) and optionally for support of time stamping of  captured  frames  as
    specified by the `-MU' parameter (see PIXCI(R) Driver Esoterica) specifies use
    of frame buffer memory for that purpose.  Currently, 64 bytes are  needed  for
    each frame buffer's capture status.

       Linux  limits the maximum amount of allocatable frame buffer memory, depen-
    dent upon what other devices are installed, the computer's total memory  size,
    and  other  factors.   Installing  the  driver immediately after booting Linux
    improves the likelihood of being able to allocate large amounts of memory.

       Linux may provide less frame buffer memory than was requested.  If no  mem-
    ory  could  be  allocated,  the  PIXCI(R) frame grabber will not be available,
    stating `Can't allocate frame buffer memory'.   Otherwise,  within  XCAP,  the
    number  of  available  frame  buffers  can be checked under PIXCI(R), PIXCI(R)
    Video Setup, Resolution.  As the frame buffer memory is allocated once  during
    the  driver's  initialization;  the  contents of frame buffers are retained as
    XCAP is closed and restarted, but lost if the driver is uninstalled  or  Linux
    is restarted.

       For  the  nVidia TK1 (ARM Cortex-A15), the nVidia TX1/TX2 (ARM Cortex-A57),
    the nVidia Nano (ARM Cortex-A57) and the Boundary Devices NITROGEN6 (ARM imx6)
    (but  not  the  nVidia Xavier or Xavier NX), the amount of frame buffer memory
    that can be allocated is limited by the kernel's `coherent  pool'  size.   For
    these embedded systems, the memory is split into various special purpose pools
    - unlike a typical desktop system.  For the  TK1,  TX1,  TX2,  increasing  the
    `coherent  pool'  size  requires editing the /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf file
    and setting the `vmalloc', `CMA', and  `coherent-pool'  parameters.   For  the
    NITROGEN6,   increasing   the   `coherent  pool'  size  requires  editing  the
    /6x_bootscript.txt file and setting the `coherent-pool' parameter, followed by
    compilation of /6x_bootscript.txt via a Boundary Devices tool, and replacement
    of the /6x_bootscript file.  Values for `coherent-pool' and  other  parameters
    must take into account all devices and requirements of the system.


    1.P.4  Linux 2.4.x - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As  described  above,  frame buffer memory allocated by pixci_i386.o during
    its installation may be limited to a small percentage of the computer's  total
    memory.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory recognized by Linux, and then instructing pixci_i386.o to explicitly use a
    section of memory without allocating it from Linux.

       Use  of  the  PIXCI(R)  - Driver Assistant within XCAP, provides convenient
    configuration of frame buffer memory allocation.   The  following  information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

      1.  Edit /etc/lilo.conf, restricting Linux to use no more than a set  amount
          of  memory:  by  copying an existing configuration group, adding mem=XXM










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          (where XX is the memory size in MiByte) to the `append' line, and chang-
          ing the prompt name.  For example, changing:

                   image=/boot/vmlinuz
                       label=linux
                       root=/dev/hda1
                       append=" devfs=mount"
                       read-only

          to

                   image=/boot/vmlinuz
                       label=linux+PIXCI
                       root=/dev/hda1
                       append=" devfs=mount mem=64M"
                       read-only

          Add an `append' line, such as:

                   append=" mem=64M"

          if not previously present.  When booting, the modified `label=' provides
          a reminder of the modified configuration being selected.

      2.  Run

                   lilo

          to compile and install the /etc/lilo.conf.

      3.  Change the Driver Configuration Parameters.  Add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory  is
          partitioned  for  the  sake of virtual memory management: (a) Each frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies  that  the  entire image memory is to be handled as one parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating systems.  For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384 is suggested;
          though the value need not be a power of two.   Systems  with  very  high
          resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the partition
          size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remaining, smaller
          than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             Be  careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the specified
          `mem=' limit - including exact base2 to base10 conversions!   (i.e.  for
          mem=64M,  the  smallest  valid  value  of  -IA  is  65536,  not 64000!).

          Likewise, be certain that the -IA plus -IM  values  do  not  exceed  the
          amount of memory available!

             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory directly below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps  other  hardware
          resources  such  as  BIOS,  memory  mapped I/O, PCI configuration space,
          etc.[10] and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use as
          frame buffers.  The usable frame buffer memory is therefore  reduced  by
          the  amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM size
          overlap the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte  address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between  the
          768 MiByte  and  1024 MiByte  addresses may be reserved; the -IA address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      4.  Reboot, using the newly added configuration.

       For example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating  256 MiByte
    for Linux and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             mem=256M

    in lilo.conf, and use:

             -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in  the  Driver  Configuration  Parameters.  Note that 262144 is 256x1024, and
    786432 is (1024-256)x1024.

       Some Linux 2.4.x systems may use grub.conf or menu.lst instead of lilo.conf
    for boot configuration; see Linux 2.6.x - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Alloca-
    tion for instructions regarding grub.conf or menu.lst.


    1.P.5  Linux 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Allocation

       As described above, frame  buffer  memory  allocated  by  pixci_i386.ko  or
    pixci_x86_64.ko  during  its installation may be limited to a small percentage
    of the computer's total memory.

       A larger frame buffer memory can be obtained by limiting the amount of mem-
    ory recognized by Linux, and then instructing pixci_i386.ko or pixci_x86_64.ko
    to explicitly use a section of memory without allocating it from Linux.

    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       Use of the PIXCI(R) - Driver Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    configuration  of  frame  buffer memory allocation.  The following information
    allows manual configuration, correcting problems, or integration with an OEM's
    procedures.

      1.  Edit  /boot/grub/grub.conf  (renamed to /boot/grub/menu.lst on some sys-
          tems), restricting Linux to use no more than a set amount of memory:  by
          copying an existing configuration group, adding mem=XXM (where XX is the
          memory size in MiByte) to the `kernel' line,  and  changing  the  prompt
          name.  For example, changing:

                   title Fedora Core (2.6.5-1.358)
                       root (hd0,0)
                       kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.5-1.358 ro root=LABEL=/ rhgb quiet
                       initrd /initrd-2.6.5-1.358.img

          to

                   title Fedora Core (2.6.5-1.358) + PIXCI
                       root (hd0,0)
                       kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.5-1.358 ro root=LABEL=/ rhgb quiet mem=64M
                       initrd /initrd-2.6.5-1.358.img

          When  booting,  the modified `title' provides a reminder of the modified
          configuration being selected.

      2.  Change the Driver Configuration Parameters.  Add:

                   -IA <image_memory_adrs_in_KiByte>
                   -IM <size_of_image_memory_in_KiByte>
                   -MB <image_memory_partition_size_in_KiByte>
                   -BH <size_of_BIOS_hole_below_4GiB_in_KiByte>

          In practice, all four fields are on the same line.

             The -MB partition size specifies the size into which image memory  is
          partitioned  for  the  sake of virtual memory management: (a) Each frame
          buffer must be completely contained within a partition, (b) A value of 0
          specifies  that  the  entire image memory is to be handled as one parti-
          tion, and (c) The maximum number of partitions is 256 under 32 bit oper-
          ating  systems,  the  maximum  number  of partitions is 256 under 64 bit
          operating systems.  For most systems, a value of 8192 or 16384  is  sug-
          gested;  though the value need not be a power of two.  Systems with very
          high resolution cameras using large frame buffers should choose the par-
          tition  size carefully, so as to minimize the unusable memory remaining,
          smaller than a frame buffer, at the end of each partition.

             Be careful that the -IA address is equal to (or above) the  specified
          `mem='  limit  - including exact base2 to base10 conversions!  (i.e. for
          mem=64M, the smallest valid value of -IA is 65536, not  64000!).   Like-
          wise,  be  certain that the -IA plus -IM values do not exceed the amount
          of memory available!











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


             On a computer populated with 4 or more GiBytes of memory, some of the
          memory  directly  below  the  4 GiByte  address  overlaps other hardware
          resources such as BIOS, memory  mapped  I/O,  PCI  configuration  space,
          etc.[11] and is unavailable to either the operating system or for use as
          frame  buffers.   The usable frame buffer memory is therefore reduced by
          the amount by which the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM  size
          overlap  the 4 GiByte address minus -BH size up to the 4 GiByte address.
          The -BH size may be set to 0 (or not specified) if the computer has sig-
          nificantly less than 4 GiBytes of memory.

             On  computers with Intel vPro Technology, computer memory between the
          768 MiByte and 1024 MiByte addresses may be reserved;  the  -IA  address
          should not be lower than the 1024 MiByte address.

      3.  Reboot, using the newly added configuration.

       For  example, for a computer with 1 GiByte of memory, allocating 256 MiByte
    for Linux and the remainder for frame buffer memory, use:

             mem=256M

    in grub.conf (or menu.lst), and use:

             -IA 262144 -IM 786432 -MB 8192

    in the Driver Configuration Parameters.  Note that  262144  is  256x1024,  and
    786432 is (1024-256)x1024.

       Some  Linux  2.6.x systems may use the older lilo.conf instead of grub.conf
    for boot configuration; see Linux 2.4.x - Forceful Frame Buffer Memory Alloca-
    tion for instructions regarding lilo.conf.

    Use of the PIXCI(R)  -  Driver  Assistant  within  XCAP,  provides  convenient
    installation of the authorization key's driver(s).

       The  following information allows manual installation, correcting problems,

    installation  directory.   Alternately, see the hardlock/drv/src_i386/Makefile
    for compiling the parallel port key driver under the current kernel, the hard-
    lock/drv/pinst shell file for installing the parallel port key driver, and the
    hardlock/sbin/dinst shell file for installing the USB key daemon,  all  within
    the XCAP installation directory.

       The  parallel  port  key driver is needed under 2.4.x, 2.6.x, 3.x, 4.x, and
    5.x i386 kernels even if the parallel port version  of  the  key  isn't  used.
    Parallel  port  keys  are  not supported under newer x86-64 kernels; the hard-
    lock/drv/src_x86_64/Makefile and related files are provided  for  legacy  sys-

    The various Driver Configuration Parameters for all operating systems are sum-
    marized below.

    The Driver Configuration Parameter string may contain  any  of  the  following
    parameters,  separated by spaces, in any order.  Each parameter's flag is fol-
    lowed by a number, whose value is interpreted as hexadecimal  if  preceded  by
    `0x' or `0X', octal if preceded by `0o' or `0O', binary if preceded by `0b' or
    `0B', and is otherwise interpreted as decimal.

         -BH n          If n!=0, the amount of memory space, in  KiByte,  directly
                        below  the  4 GiByte address which overlaps other hardware
                        resources such as BIOS, memory mapped I/O, PCI  configura-
                        tion space, etc.  and is unavailable to either the operat-
                        ing  system  or  for  use as frame buffers.[12] The usable
                        frame buffer memory is therefore reduced by the amount  by
                        which  the -IA address up to the -IA address plus -IM size
                        overlap the 4 GiByte address minus  -BH  size  up  to  the
                        4 GiByte  address.   Only  used  with forceful image frame
                        buffer allocation, under Windows NT,  2000,  XP,  XP(x64),
                        Vista 32/64-Bit,  7 32/64-Bit,  8/10 32/64-Bit, 11 64-Bit,
                        Linux 32 Bit, and Linux 64 Bit.  Default: 0.

         -BS n          If n!=0, per-frame buffer capture  status  is  maintained.
                        If n=0, per-frame buffer capture status is not maintained.
                        Also see the -MU parameter.  Default: 1.

                        Camera  Link  PIXCI(R)  frame grabbers support PoCL; older
                        versions apply PoCL whenever the frame grabber is  powered
                        on;  newer  versions  disable PoCL when the PIXCI(R) frame
                        grabber is closed by software - subject  to  this  option.
                        Setting  bit 0x01 will also disable running of `data path'
                        startup diagnostics.  Default: 0.

                           For the PIXCI(R) CL3SD  and  SI2  which  have  on-board
                        frame  buffer memory, memory reserved by this parameter is
                        needed for DMA buffers (approximately  1 MiByte).   Memory
                        reserved  by  this parameter is also, optionally, used for
                        support of recording per-frame buffer capture  status,  as
                        specified by the `-MU' parameter.  Currently, 64 bytes are
                        needed for each frame buffer's capture  status.   Default:
                        4096 KiByte.

         -I2C  n         Bit  rate  of  the  I2C or other two wire serial bus used
                        within some PIXCI(R) frame grabbers.  Specifies  an  upper
                        bound  for  the  bit rate; actual bit rate is dependent on
                        characteristics of the computer system  and  is  typically
                        slower.   Value  of 0 selects predefined, board-dependent,
                        default values.

                           Particularly useful for use with SILICON VIDEO(R) 10C6,

                        events  instead  of  `jiffies' and `HZ'; however, the high
                        resolution timer incurs additional  overhead.   Only  used
                        with  Linux  32 Bit and Linux 64 Bit.  The new -.TI option
                        supersedes this option.

                           If bit 0x80 is set with non forceful memory allocation,
                        frame buffer memory below 4 GiByte is requested; on 64 bit

         -MB  n          If n!=0, the image frame buffer memory, of size specified
                        by `-IM', is  split  into  partitions  of  this  size,  in
                        KiByte.   Depending  on operating system and `-IA' parame-
                        ters, this may imply that each partition  is  individually
                        allocated, so that a larger, total amount of memory can be
                        allocated.  Or that the contiguous memory  is  treated  as
                        individual partitions for the sake of the operating system
                        and processor's virtual memory management, which could not
                        otherwise  `map'  the  entire frame buffer memory at once.
                        In either case, (a) A single  frame  buffer  can't  extend
                        across partitions, (b) The partition size should be a mul-
                        tiple of the frame buffer size so as to maximize the  num-
                        ber  of buffers and minimize wasted space, and (c) A maxi-
                        mum of 256 partitions is supported under 32 bit  operating
                        systems, a maximum of 256 partitions is supported under 64
                        bit operating systems.  Default: 0.

         -MH n          If n!=0, the amount of lower memory, in  KiByte,  to  pass

                        memory.  This may be necessary for use with some  graphics
                        display  or network interface cards which, a) May be allo-
                        cating memory later than the PIXCI(R) driver,  and  b) May
                        require  memory with lower addresses.  Only used with non-

         -MO n          Reserved for future use.  Default: 0.

         -MU  n          If  bit  0x01  is not set, the frame buffer memory is not
                        mapped directly into the application's address space.   If
                        bit  0x02  is  set,  the frame buffer memory is not perma-
                        nently mapped into  the  driver's  address  space.   These
                        options  minimize use of the operating systems memory man-
                        agement resources, but may increase overhead in  accessing
                        frame buffer memory.  These options are typically required
                        when using very large amounts of frame buffer memory (typ-
                        ically,  more  than  1 or 2 GiByte under Windows NT, 2000,

                        currently supported for all Video Format Configurations.

                           If  bit 0x04 is not set, the frame buffer memory is not
                        cleared after allocation, minimizing  delay,  particularly
                        when using several GiBytes of frame buffer memory.

                           If  bit 0x08 is not set, a portion of frame buffer mem-
                        ory is reserved for recording each per-frame buffer's cap-
                        ture status, such as stamping the time of capture.  Use of
                        frame buffer memory for capture status  may  not  be  sup-
                        ported  when using forceful image frame buffer allocation.
                        If bit 0x08 is set, memory is allocated  dynamically  from
                        the  operating  system  for  recording each frame buffer's
                        capture status.  The amount  of  space  reserved,  or  the
                        amount  of  space allocated, is proportional to the number
                        of frame buffers.  The dynamic memory allocation option is
                        not  available  under  Windows 95, 98, or ME; and the per-
                        frame buffer status is discarded upon closing the PIXCI(R)

                        tion  with  Camera  Link  serial  communication.  (For the
                        PIXCI(R) CL3SD which has on-board frame buffer  memory,  a
                        small  static buffer is used in place of frame buffer mem-
                        ory).  If bit 0x20 is set, memory is allocated dynamically
                        from  the  operating  system for serial data buffers.  The
                        dynamic memory allocation option is  not  available  under

                        used for recording per frame buffer's  capture  status  is
                        cleared  (i.e.  set  to  zero) whenever the capture format
                        resolution, bit depth, bit packing, or color space options
                        are changed.  This is intended so that display of the con-

                        before  a  new  image is captured, will show a black image
                        (or green for YUYV formats) rather  than  `garbled'  pixel
                        data.   This  option  is ignored when using forceful image
                        frame buffer allocation, or for frame  grabbers  with  on-

                               2.  XCAP Software Guide





       XCAP is a family of sophisticated, interactive, imaging  programs  specifi-
    cally designed to support the PIXCI(R) series of frame grabbers, but also able
    to process and analyze images from other imaging sources.  Several versions of
    XCAP are available: XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, XCAP-Ltd, XCAP-Lite, and XCAP-Viewer.
    All versions share the same user interface and menu  structure,  but  selected
    features  in  XCAP-Std,  XCAP-Ltd,  XCAP-Lite,  and XCAP-Viewer are not opera-
    tional.  XCAP is distributed on CD/DVD, or downloadable from  the  EPIX,  Inc.
    website.   After  installation,  a  12  character activation or ID code[13] is
    entered  to  configure  XCAP  as  either XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, XCAP-Ltd,[14] or
    XCAP-Lite;  or,  lacking  a  valid  activation or ID code, configured as XCAP-
    Viewer.

    XCAP-Std is an interactive, imaging program designed  for  scientific,  indus-
    trial,  and machine vision applications.  XCAP-Std supports the PIXCI(R) frame
    grabber, providing  video  format  and  resolution  configuration;  continuous
    (live),  video  rate  sequence, and triggered capture; and single or sequence,
    zoomed or resized, display.  The image frame buffers of PIXCI(R)  frame  grab-
    bers  can  be  loaded, examined, processed, analyzed, measured, printed, anno-
    tated, and saved.

       XCAP-Std also allows loading, analyzing, modifying, and saving a pre-exist-
    ing  image  or image sequence with size, pixel depth, and color space indepen-
    dent of the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's configuration; XCAP-Std can be used  with
    pre-existing  images  even  when  the  PIXCI(R)  frame grabber is not present.
    XCAP-Std can also acquire images from TWAIN compliant devices.

    XCAP-Plus provides extra, advanced, features in addition to all of  the  capa-
    bilities of the XCAP-Std, such as support for specialized, optional, hardware.

    XCAP-Ltd  is  a  simplified  version  of XCAP-Std.  XCAP-Ltd provides the same
    image acquisition and PIXCI(R) frame grabber control  capabilities,  the  same
    image  display  features, and the same image loading, examining, printing, and


    __________

    13. The activation or ID code is provided on a card enclosed with the CD/DVD
        and is also shown on the packing list.  The card and the activation or ID
        code may be required as proof of purchase for future software upgrades.
        Keep the card in a safe place!!

    14. XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, and XCAP-Ltd require an authorization key to activate
        all features.

    saving of single image or sequences of images.  Only minimal image processing,
    measurement, analysis, and scripting features are functional.  XCAP-Ltd can be
    used with pre-existing images even when the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber  is  not
    present.

    XCAP-Lite  is a much simplified version of XCAP-Std.  XCAP-Lite provides simi-
    lar image acquisition and PIXCI(R) frame grabber control  capabilities,  video
    format  and  resolution configuration; continuous (live), video rate sequence,
    and triggered capture; and single or sequence,  zoomed  or  resized,  display.
    XCAP-Lite  also  provides  some of the image loading, examining, printing, and
    saving features, but minimal processing, measurement, analysis, and  scripting
    features  are  functional.  XCAP-Lite allows loading and saving single images,
    as well as image sequences in TIFF format.

    XCAP-Viewer allows browsing through the  dozens  of  processing,  measurement,
    analysis,  and graphics features provided in XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, XCAP-Ltd, or
    XCAP-Lite.  XCAP-Viewer can load and display pre-existing single images.   The
    PIXCI(R) frame grabber can't be operated with the XCAP-Viewer version.

       As  XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std,  XCAP-Ltd,  XCAP-Lite, and XCAP-Viewer share many
    common features, this manual typically refers to all versions as XCAP,  except
    where explicitly differentiated.

       The  XCAP  features are organized into two major types of windows, the Main
    Window and one or more Image Viewer Windows.

       For each image, or sequence of images, an Image Viewer  Window  shows  that
    image, or a selected image of that sequence, and via its menu bar allows view-
    ing, examining, processing, analyzing, or drawing upon that image  (sequence).
    The  Image  Viewer  Window  associated with the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's frame
    buffers also provides features for capturing new images.  There can be  multi-
    ple Image Viewer Windows for the same image (sequence), allowing, for example,
    viewing the image both magnified (i.e. zoom) and unmagnified, or  simultaneous
    viewing of different images of a sequence.

       The  Main  Window allows creating new image (sequences), and thus new Image
    Viewer Windows, either by loading a new image from file,  explicit  specifica-
    tion  of  the new image's dimensions, or by opening the PIXCI(R) frame grabber
    for use.  Video setup for the PIXCI(R) frame grabber, such  as  modifying  the
    video  resolution  or color space, are also in the Main Window; these features
    may close and re-create the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's Image Viewer Window.  The
    Main  Window  also  provides  features  not  directly associated with an image
    (sequence), such as scripts, RS-232 device control, and features to  customize




















    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    XCAP.


    2.A  The Main Window

       The  XCAP main window provides a menu bar with File, Images, Scripts, Util-
    ity, PIXCI(R), and Help features.


    2.A.1  Main Window - File

       The main window's File allows loading of pre-existing images into new image
    buffers, displaying attributes about pre-existing images, and acquiring images
    from TWAIN compliant devices.

       The Load New Image and Load New Image Sequence creates a new  image  buffer
    (sequence)  with dimensions, pixel depth, and color space matching a specified
    AVI (Audio Video Interleaved), BigTIFF (Tagged Image File Format extended  for
    large  file sizes), BMP (Bitmap), FITS (Flexible Image Transport System), JPEG
    (Joint Photographic Exports Group), PBM/PGM/PBM (Portable Bit/Gray/Pixel Map),
    TIFF  (Tagged  Image  File Format), VIF (Video Frame Files - Video to Disk) or
    multimedia format file(s), and loads the image(s) from the file(s).  This fea-
    ture,  and  the  image buffer (sequence) created, is unrelated to the PIXCI(R)
    frame grabber's frame buffers.  After creation  and  loading,  the  new  image
    (sequence)  is  displayed,  processed,  and  analyzed in a new instance of The
    Image Viewer Window, described below.  Using wild cards, the  Load  New  Image
    can  also load multiple image files - each to their own new image buffer.  The
    Load New Image can also load images directly from an Internet URL.

       The Image File Info displays information about a  specified  AVI,  BigTIFF,
    BMP,  FITS,  JPEG,  PBM/PGM/PPM,  TIFF, or VIF format file without loading the
    image.  The information  displayed  includes  the  image's  dimensions,  pixel
    depth,  color  space,  palette option, and other file format specific informa-
    tion.

       The TWAIN Select Source and TWAIN New Acquire allow using XCAP as  a  TWAIN
    Application,  acquiring  images  from  TWAIN  compliant imaging devices (TWAIN
    Sources).  The TWAIN Select Source allows selecting which TWAIN Source  is  to
    be  used,  and the TWAIN New Acquire allows acquiring one image from the TWAIN
    Source.

       The Window List displays a  list  of  active  windows  belonging  to  XCAP;
    selecting  a window causes that window to appear, if previously hidden, and/or
    to appear over other windows (subject to the priority of selected  windows  to
    always appear `on top').


    2.A.2  Main Window - Images

       The  main  window's Images allows creating new image buffers and activating
    any existing image windows that may not be on-screen.












    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The New Image creates a new image buffer, or  sequence  of  image  buffers,
    with  specified  dimensions, pixel depth, color space, and palette.  This fea-
    ture, and the image buffer created, is unrelated to the PIXCI(R)  frame  grab-
    ber's  frame  buffers.   After  creation,  the new image is displayed in a new
    instance of The Image Viewer Window, as described below.

       Underneath New Image are listed all existing  image  windows,  whether  for
    PIXCI(R)  frame grabber frame buffers, or for independent image buffers.  (The
    image window for PIXCI(R) frame grabber frame buffers appears only  after  the
    PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber has been opened for use, see below).  An image window
    which has been closed and is thereby off-screen can be reactivated by clicking
    the image window's name.


    2.A.3  Main Window - Scripts

       The  main  window's  Scripts  provides  features  for recording and playing
    scripts.  A script recording contains most of the user's interactions with the
    windows of XCAP; playing the script duplicates the original actions.

       Some  user actions are not recorded.  Using the mouse to drag the cursor or
    other graphic across an image is not recorded  as  these  actions  are  highly
    dependent  upon  image  content  (such as the typical scenario of dragging the
    cursor until it is positioned next to an artifact in a captured image),  would
    likely  be  inappropriate  to  other captured images, and recording each mouse
    `step' would consume a significant amount of disk space.  Instead, after posi-
    tioning  the  cursor  interactively  the user can record the final position by
    clicking the appropriate numeric cursor coordinates.  Similarly,  the  activa-
    tion  of  a  feature  with  shortcut  keys  or shortcut icons is not recorded;
    instead features can be activated via the non-shortcut alternative,  which  is
    recorded.

       A  recorded  script is in a human readable form and can be altered with any
    common editor capable of handling ASCII text, allowing scripts to be  modified
    or  combined.   A  selected  script  may  be executed automatically after XCAP
    starts, this feature is set in Utility, Program Setup, Startup Script.

       The Load Tool Bar provides one or more user-defined tool bars of shortcuts,
    each  shortcut  represented  by  an icon which, when clicked, executes a user-
    specified script.  Each shortcut may also specify  an  optional  keyboard  key
    which, when pressed, also executes the user-specified script.

       The Script Remote Control allows using XCAP as a hidden, off-screen, `black
    box'; any end-user application  that  can  manipulate  text  files,  can  also
    remotely control XCAP.


    2.A.4  Main Window - Utility

       The  main  window's  Utility provides an assortment of features that are of
    secondary importance; features that allow fine tuning  of  XCAP,  or  features
    needed in relatively few circumstances.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The  Black Board allows customizing XCAP, creating non-procedural programs,
    and collecting data.  The black board allows inter-connecting the numeric  and
    text  field of other windows; computed results, such as center-of-mass, may be
    written onto the black board - parameters for  other  features,  such  as  the
    coordinates  of a displayed grid, may be extracted from the black board - com-
    bining these automatically repositions the grid  as  the  center  of  mass  is
    recomputed!   Other features allow computed values (similar to a spreadsheet),
    `push'ing buttons, timed updates, creating a report to file or an RS-232 port,
    collecting data, and graphing the black board's contents.

       A  Message  Log window lists warnings and errors that arise from performing
    various operations.  By default, the message log window appears  automatically
    when a message is added, and disappears a few seconds later.  Auto appearance,
    auto hide, and audible clicks can be disabled (from the message  log  window's
    menu  bar).  The menu-bar's Message Log allows explicit activation of the mes-
    sage log window.

       The Program Setup shows information about the  installed  XCAP  components,
    such  as  their  revision  level, and sets various configuration options.  For
    versions of XCAP that require an authorization key, it also shows  the  ID  of
    the key required by the instant copy of XCAP.

       The  Program  Setup  allows  specifying the name of a script to be executed
    when XCAP starts, whether warning pop-up windows (if any)  are  to  be  shown,
    whether  previously saved settings are to be loaded, and other similar initial
    or terminal conditions.

       The Program Setup also enables user-defined translation of XCAP labels  and
    messages for use in non-English speaking countries.

       The  Windows  Info  displays information about the current Windows environ-
    ment, such as memory usage and the  graphics  display  system's  features,  as
    reported  by  Windows.   The Linux Info displays information about the current
    Linux environment, such as memory usage and the graphics display system's fea-
    tures,  as  reported  by  Linux.  The Java Info displays information about the
    status of Java, under which XCAP runs.  Both of these features  are  primarily
    of use in resolving questions submitted to EPIX, Inc. Technical Support.

       The  Window Style allows setting some characteristics of XCAP windows, such
    as color or character size and font.  Some characteristics of window style are
    instead controlled by the Windows Control Panel.

       The  Audio  Clip  (only  under  Windows) allows recording and playing short
    audio `clips'.

       The RS-232 Terminal allows `raw'  communication  with  a  camera  or  other
    device  connected  via  the  computer's  RS-232  port.  The RS-232 Terminal is
    designed specifically for device control,  including  options  to  communicate
    with  byte values, rather than as a common `terminal emulator'.  XCAP may also
    provide more convenient, camera-specific `smart' controls,  provided  after  a
    camera-specific frame grabber is opened, via the Capture - Adjustments.

       The  I/O  Port  Peek & Poke allows controlling arbitrary devices accessible
    via I/O port peeks and pokes.  This feature must be used with caution; peeking
    or  poking  arbitrary  ports will cause computer malfunction!  This feature is
    only available under Windows 95, 98, and ME.

       The Screen Capture allows capturing the current  graphics  display  screen,
    saving  the  graphics to a file, or printing the graphics.  The Screen Capture
    also allows capturing numeric and textual parameters into a text  file,  suit-
    able for loading into a spreadsheet or other programs.

       The  Volpi intralux dc-1100 and Illumination Technologies 3900 provide sup-
    port for controlling these light sources through their RS-232 ports.

       The Birger EF232 provides support for controlling the Birger  EF232  RS-232
    Lens Mount.

       The  Fujinon CCTV Lens provides support for controlling Fujinon CCTV Lenses
    that follow the Fujinon C10 Protocol.

       The Directed Perception Pan-Tilt Unit provides support for controlling  the
    Directed Perception Pan-Tilt Units.

       The  Sagebrush  Pan-Tilt  Gimbal provides support for controlling the Sage-
    brush Pan-Tilt Gimbals that follow the Sagebrush 2.0 Protocol.

       The EPIX(R) SILICON  VIDEO(R)  20C-CL,  EPIX(R)  SILICON  VIDEO(R)  20M-CL,
    EPIX(R)  SILICON  VIDEO(R) 1514CL, and EPIX(R) SILICON VIDEO(R) 1820CL provide
    support for configuring the EPIX(R) SILICON VIDEO(R) 10C-CL, SILICON  VIDEO(R)
    10M-CL,  SILICON  VIDEO(R)  20C-CL,  SILICON VIDEO(R) 20M-CL, SILICON VIDEO(R)
    1514CL, and SILICON VIDEO(R) 1820CL cameras via a virtual  `COM'  port  (under
    Windows),  a  virtual `ttyS' device (under Linux), or a Camera Link Serial API
    DLL (i.e. a clserXXX.DLL, under Windows).  These are provided for  configuring
    the  camera  when  using a frame grabber other than an PIXCI(R) frame grabber,
    leaving configuration of the frame grabber to  its  software.   When  using  a
    PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber, the alternative PIXCI(R) - Open/Close is recommended
    as it provides integrated controls for both camera and frame grabber.


    2.A.5  Main Window - PIXCI(R)

       The main window's PIXCI(R) allows initiating access to the  PIXCI(R)  frame
    grabber  and provides configuration options.  Actual operation of the PIXCI(R)
    frame grabber is performed through the PIXCI(R) image  viewer  window's  menu-
    bar.

       The PIXCI(R) Open/Close allows opening access to, or closing access to, the
    PIXCI(R) frame grabber.  Once open, the model, and submodel or preset camera &
    format  selection,  as appropriate, of the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is available
    via the Board Info button.  After opening, the contents of the PIXCI(R)  frame
    grabber's  image  frame buffer(s) are displayed in a new instance of The Image
    Viewer Window, along with a tool bar of PIXCI(R)  Image  Viewer  -  Capture  -
    Shortcuts  and  a  status bar of Image Viewer - View - Status Bar are shown as
    described below.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The PIXCI(R) Video Setup allows configuring the video format, video resolu-
    tion  and other, model specific, video characteristics.  For the PIXCI(R) SV2,
    SV3, SV4, SV5, SV5A, SV5B, and SV5L models, the PIXCI(R)  Video  Setup  allows
    selecting  NTSC,  RS-170,  NTSC/S-VIDEO,  CCIR,  PAL,  or PAL/S-Video formats,
    allows selecting the video window size, capture resolution,  and  other  video
    acquisition characteristics.

       For  the  PIXCI(R) SV7  models,  the  PIXCI(R) Video Setup allows selecting
    NTSC, RS-170, CCIR, or PAL formats , allows selecting the video  window  size,
    capture resolution, and other video acquisition characteristics.

       For  the  PIXCI(R) SV8  models,  the  PIXCI(R) Video Setup allows selecting
    NTSC, RS-170, NTSC/S-VIDEO, CCIR, PAL, or PAL/S-Video formats, allows  select-
    ing  the  video  window  size, capture resolution, and other video acquisition
    characteristics.

       For the PIXCI(R) A310 model, the  PIXCI(R)  Video  Setup  allows  selecting
    Video  720x480i  60Hz  (RS-170),  Video 720x480i 60Hz RGB, Video 720x576i 50Hz
    (CCIR), Video 720x576i 50Hz RGB, Video 1920x1080i 60Hz, Video 1920x1080i  60Hz
    RGB,  Video 1920x1080i 50Hz, Video 1920x1080i 50Hz RGB, Video 1920x1080p 60Hz,
    Video 1920x1080p 60Hz RGB, Video 1920x1080p 50Hz, Video 1920x1080p  50Hz  RGB,
    Video  1280x720p  50Hz,  Video 1280x720p 50Hz RGB, Video 1280x720p 60Hz, Video
    1280x720p 60Hz RGB, RS330 720x480i 60Hz, RS343 875i 60Hz, RS343 875i 60Hz RGB,
    SVGA  800x600 60Hz, SVGA 800x600 60Hz RGB, SXGA 1280x1024 60Hz, SXGA 1280x1024
    60Hz RGB, VGA 640x480 60Hz, VGA 640x480 60Hz RGB, XGA  1024x768  60Hz  or  XGA
    1024x768  60Hz  RGB formats, allows modifying the PLL, A/D, and sync processor
    parameters to accommodate other video formats, allows  selecting  the  capture
    resolution,  and  selecting  other video acquisition characteristics.  For the
    PIXCI(R) A110 model, the PIXCI(R) Video Setup is similar, but does  not  allow
    selecting RGB formats.

       For  the PIXCI(R) CL1, CL3SD, D, D24, D32, D2X, D3X, and D3XE models, fewer
    options are provided, as these frame grabbers are each customized to  specifi-
    cally   support   one  camera,  or  a  related  group  if  cameras.   For  the
    PIXCI(R) CL2, E1,  E1DB,  E4,  E4DB,  E4G2-2F,  E4G2-4B,  E4G2-F2B,  E4TX2-2F,
    E4TX2-4B,  E4TX2-F2B,  E8, E8DB, e104x4-2f, e104x4-4b, e104x4-f2b, EB1, EB1G2,
    EB1-PoCL, EB1G2-PoCL, EB1mini, miniH2B, miniH2F, miniH2x4F, mf2280, EC1, ECB1,
    ECB1-34, ECB2, EL1, and EL1DB models, which provide universal support for Cam-
    era Link cameras, fewer options are provided.  For the  PIXCI(R) E8CAM,  ELS2,
    SI,  SI1,  SI2,  and SI4 models, which support SILICON VIDEO(R) cameras, fewer
    options are provided.  For all of these, a different camera can  be  selected,
    if available, via PIXCI(R) Open/Close, Camera & Format.

       The  current video setup is automatically saved when access to the PIXCI(R)
    frame grabber is closed, and reloaded when the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is later
    opened.   The  PIXCI(R) Export Video Setup and PIXCI(R) Import Video Setup may
    be used to explicitly save or reload the  current  video  setup,  such  as  to
    choose  amongst  several favorite setups, or to export the current video setup
    to the XCLIB library.

       The PIXCI(R) Status shows the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's current status, such
    as  the state of the general purpose (formerly referred to as an external TTL)
    trigger input(s) and output(s),  the  number  of  elapsed  video  fields,  the










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    board's  model,  submodel or preset camera & format selection, as appropriate,
    and configured image memory size.

       The PIXCI(R) Serial Terminal allows `raw' communication with a camera  con-
    nected  to  the  serial port on selected models of the PIXCI(R) frame grabber.
    For many cameras, XCAP includes more convenient, camera-specific `smart'  con-
    trols,  provided after a camera-specific frame grabber is opened, via the Cap-
    ture - Adjustments.

       The PIXCI(R) Connections provides, as appropriate for the specific model of
    PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber, a map of the board's connections, connectors, option
    jumpers, and adjustments.

       The PIXCI(R) Camera Info provides a list of cameras and video formats  sup-
    ported  by XCAP and various PIXCI(R) frame grabbers.  The PIXCI(R) Camera Info
    also allows viewing a non-operational Capture - Adjustments window  (i.e.  the
    `Control  Panel',  which provides integrated control of both frame grabber and
    any supported camera).

       The PIXCI(R) TWAIN Sourcery (only under Windows) allows using XCAP, in con-
    junction  with  the  `XCAP Sourcery' TWAIN driver, as a component of a `smart'
    TWAIN Source, allowing other applications to capture images from the  PIXCI(R)
    frame  grabber,  while  XCAP provides frame grabber controls, camera controls,
    and, optionally, image preprocessing.[15] The PIXCI(R) TWAIN  Sourcery  should
    not  be  confused  with  TWAIN  New Acquire; the former allows XCAP to provide
    image data to other, TWAIN compliant applications; the latter allows  XCAP  to
    accept  image  data from other TWAIN compliant sources.  The TWAIN New Acquire
    should never be used to attempt to acquire image data from the PIXCI(R)  TWAIN
    Sourcery!

       The  PIXCI(R) Image-Pro Sourcery (only under Windows) allows using XCAP, in
    conjunction with the `XCAP Sourcery' Image-Pro driver, as  a  component  of  a
    `smart'  video  source, allowing Image-Pro to capture images from the PIXCI(R)
    frame grabber, while  XCAP  provides  frame  grabber,  camera  controls,  and,
    optionally, image preprocessing.[16]


    2.B  The Image Viewer Window

       Each  image  buffer (sequence), or frame buffer (sequence), is displayed in
    an image viewer window, which is the focus of activity for examining, process-
    ing,  or analyzing that image buffer (sequence).  The image viewer window pro-
    vides a menu bar with File, View, Examine, Modify,  Measure,  Draw,  AOI,  and
    Help  features.   The  image  viewer window associated with the PIXCI(R) frame
    grabber's frame buffer(s) also provides a Capture feature.


    2.B.1  Image Viewer - File

       The image viewer window's File allows  saving,  loading,  or  printing  the
    image,  shows  information about the image's dimensions, pixel depth and color
    space, and allows closing the image viewer window.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The Load Image and Save Image allow saving or loading the image in a  vari-
    ety  of  file  formats.   The  Load Image, unlike the Load New Image described
    above, loads an image file into the  current  image  buffer,  resizing  and/or
    color  converting  to fit the image buffer's existing dimensions, pixel depth,
    and color space.  The Load Image can also load images directly from an  Inter-
    net URL.

       For image viewer windows associated with an image buffer sequence, the Save
    Image Sequence and Load Image Sequence allow saving or loading multiple images
    of  the  sequence  as  a numbered sequence of image files, or as a single AVI,
    BigTIFF, FITS, PBM/PGM/PPM, or TIFF format image file  with  multiple  images.
    Save Image can also save images directly to an FTP URL.

       The  E-Mail Image allows directly e-mailing the image, in a variety of file
    formats, from within XCAP.

       The Print Image allows printing the image; either via  the  operating  sys-
    tem's built-in image printing feature(s) which typically supports a wide vari-
    ety of printers, or via EPIX(R) imaging drivers which support  only  the  most
    popular printers, but providing precise control of print options.

       The  Image  Attributes  shows the image's (or image sequence's) dimensions,
    pixel depth, and color space.

       The Duplicate Image and Duplicate Image  Sequence  allows  creating  a  new
    image  buffer  and  copying  the  current image, or creating a new sequence of
    image buffers and copying the current image  sequence,  respectively,  in  one
    step.   It optionally allows copying the image's (or image sequence's) current
    appearance, as modified by the palette and graphics, instead of the underlying
    image (or image sequence).

       The BlackBoard Image allows copying the image's pixel values into the Black
    Board.

       The Close Viewer  closes  the  window,  but  does  not  destroy  the  image
    (sequence).   The  Close & Dispose of Image closes the window and destroys the
    image (sequence).  The image viewer window associated with the PIXCI(R)  frame
    grabber's  frame  buffer(s)  does  not  provide a Close & Dispose of Image; an
    image viewer window is available whenever the PIXCI(R) frame grabber  is  open
    for use.


    2.B.2  Image Viewer - View

       The image viewer window's View provides options governing the appearance of
    the displayed image.

       The Shortcuts allows activating or deactivating a tool bar of icons provid-
    ing  shortcuts for accessing often used features, and is described under Image
    Viewer - View - Shortcuts.

       The Status Bar allows activating or deactivating a small  status  bar  with
    current information, and is described under Image Viewer - View - Status Bar.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The  Menu  Bar allows activating or deactivating the menu bar; when deacti-
    vated, clicking the mouse right-click button allows restoring the menu bar.

       For image viewer windows associated with the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's image
    frame  buffer(s),  the Adjustments allows setting common adjustments, as suit-
    able for the model of the PIXCI(R) frame grabber  in  use,  and  is  described
    under PIXCI(R) Image Viewer - Capture.

       The  Full  Screen  allows displaying the image in the full graphics display
    screen without the menu bar, centered with black border (if needed), and  with
    little  or  no window `frame' around the image.  The previous display mode can
    be restored via a mouse right-click.

       The Always-On-Top allows forcing the image viewer window, and  its  subwin-
    dows,  to  always be `above' other windows; subject to the other windows' also
    requesting Always-On-Top, and the whims of the host  operating  system.   This
    option  is  typically  useful only when XCAP is being used in combination with
    other applications, such as in conjunction with the PIXCI(R) TWAIN Sourcery or
    PIXCI(R)  Image-Pro  Sourcery feature.  The Always-On-Top feature is only sup-
    ported under Windows.

       The Refresh forces the displayed image to be redrawn once; normally  manual
    refresh  is  not needed, but occasionally, when the image was (partly) covered
    and uncovered by other window(s), the displayed image  might  `forget'  to  be
    updated.

       For images composed of index pixels and palette, the Image's Palette allows
    manipulating the image's attached palette; for  images  of  other  types,  the
    Image's  Palette  is  not  selectable.   For  all images, the Viewer's Palette
    allows manipulating a palette which is not attached to the image.  Either  can
    be  used for contrast enhancement, adjustment of black level and gain, or, for
    monochrome images, false coloring.  Either, or neither, of the palettes can be
    selected for use under Display.

       For image sequences, the Sequence Play allows `playing' the sequence, image
    by image, at a selected rate.  The Sequence Thumbnails window shows each image
    of  a sequence as a small `thumbnail' image, allowing compact presentation and
    review of the entire image sequence.  Clicking on a thumbnail can select  that
    image for display by the image viewer window.

       The  Cursor  allows  activating a cursor over the image, which may be posi-
    tioned via coordinates, or by left clicking the mouse on an image feature.

       The Display allows selecting how the image is displayed: (a) No resizing so
    there  is  a  one  to  one relationship between an image pixel and a displayed
    graphics display pixel and is the quickest, although the entire image may  not
    fit within the window and must therefore be panned and scrolled, (b) Resize by
    nearest neighbor which is relatively quick, or (c) Resize by bilinear interpo-
    lation  which  may  produce  better results for continuous tone images, but is
    slower.  For the resize modes, the aspect ratio can  also  be  modified.   The
    Display  allows  selecting which palette, if any, is to be used during display
    and during file loads and saves.  An option to display  only  even  lines,  or
    only odd image lines, allows avoiding interlace artifacts during display.  For










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    the image viewer window associated with the  PIXCI(R)  frame  grabber's  frame
    buffer(s),  the  Display  provides  additional features, identical to the Live
    Options described below.

       The Zoom, Pan, Scroll allows magnifying the displayed  image,  panning  and
    scrolling  to  view  different portions of the image under magnification.  For
    image sequences, a specific image of the sequence can be selected for display.
    In  addition to panning and scrolling via explicit coordinates and via scroll-
    bars, holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse over the image  also
    implements  panning and scrolling.  Optionally, the left or right mouse button
    can be used to increase magnification (i.e. zoom-in) or decrease magnification
    (i.e. zoom-out).

       The Flip & Mirror allows flipping and mirroring the displayed image so that
    the top is displayed to the top, left, right, or bottom.

       Each image buffer (sequence) may have several simultaneously  active  view-
    ers,  allowing,  for example, viewing the same image buffer both magnified and
    unmagnified.  The Launch 2nd Viewer creates a second image viewer window  into
    the same image buffer (sequence), with the same features as the original image
    viewer window.


    2.B.3  Image Viewer - Examine

       The image viewer window's Examine provides options to examine the image.

       The Pixel Peek allows numeric display of the pixel values in  the  vicinity
    of  the image cursor -- within a single image, or across a sequence of images,
    or of a multi-image stack.  The feature also graphically displays each pixel's
    value or trends.

       The Pixel Peek & Poke allows numeric display and modification of individual
    pixel values.  The Pixel Peek & Poke also allows precise, single pixel,  image
    editing.

       The  Pixel  Plot  displays a two-dimensional graph of pixels values along a
    selected image line or column, of all image lines  or  columns,  of  an  image
    pixel  as  it varies across an image sequence, of rows or columns as they vary
    across an image sequence, or of a multi-image stack.   The  recent  trends  of
    pixel values can also be shown, as an fading `echo,' to help visually evaluate
    the fluctuations of live video or the effects of camera adjustments.  Features
    attached  to  the  graph show specific pixel values and descriptive statistics
    such as lowest value, highest value, mean value, and standard deviation.

       The Pixel Plot 3D displays the numeric values of  pixels  as  as  a  three-
    dimensional graph -- from a single image or from a multi-image `stack' -- with
    the image X and Y coordinates composing two dimensions, and the  pixel  values
    composing the third dimension.

       The  Pixel  Magnifier allows enlarging an area of the displayed image, with
    an effect similar to using a magnifying lens.  Optionally, contrast and  other
    enhancements can be applied to the magnified area.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The SMPTE VITC allows searching the image for valid SMPTE Vertical Interval
    Time Codes and displaying the decoded codes.


    2.B.4  Image Viewer - Modify

       The image viewer window's Modify provides image processing operations which
    modify  the  image, modify each image (independently) in a sequence (typically
    named `Sequence ...')  or modify one or more images in a sequence by combining
    data from across multiple images (typically named `... Sequence ).'

       The  Patterns  draws various test patterns in the image.  The Sequence Pat-
    terns does the same on each image of a sequence.

       The Set sets image pixels to a specified value.  The Sequence Set does  the
    same on each image of a sequence.

       The  Arithmetic  provides pixel arithmetic, such as adding a constant value
    or multiplying by a constant value.  The Sequence Arithmetic does the same  on
    each  image of a sequence.  The Src+Dst Arithmetic does the same with distinct
    source and destination images.

       The Binning provides averaging or integrating pixel values in `bins'  of  a
    checkerboard.  The Sequence Binning does the same on each image of a sequence.
    The Src+Dst Binning does the same with distinct source and destination images.

       The Contrast Modification  allows  modifying  the  image's  contrast.   The
    Sequence Contrast Modification does the same on each image of a sequence.  The
    Src+Dst Contrast Modification does the same with distinct source and  destina-
    tion images.

       The Convolution allows convolving the image with user-defined kernels.  The
    Sequence Convolution does the same on each image of a sequence.   The  Src+Dst
    Convolution does the same with distinct source and destination images.

       The  Correlation Map allows correlating, or matching, a kernel image over a
    larger image, resulting in a profile image whose intensity, at each  location,
    varies  in  proportion  to the degree of match at that location.  The Sequence
    Correlation Map does the same on each image of a sequence.  The Src+Dst Corre-
    lation Map does the same with distinct source and destination images.

       The  Edge  Detection provides Kirsch, Sobel, and other standard edge detec-
    tors.  The Sequence Edge Detection does the same on each image of a  sequence.
    The  Src+Dst Edge Detection does the same with distinct source and destination
    images.

       The FFT provides Fast Fourier Transforms and Discrete  Fourier  Transforms.
    The  Sequence  FFT does the same on each image of a sequence.  The Src+Dst FFT
    does the same with distinct source and destination images.

       The HSB Tweak provides hue, saturation, and brightness  adjustments  within
    the HSB color space.  While Arithmetic and other operations can optionally use
    the HSB color space to, for example,  multiply  all  saturation  values  by  a

    2.B.5  Image Viewer - Measure

       The  image  viewer window's Measure provides features for image measurement
    and analysis, including user-defined coordinate systems and  mapping  intensi-
    ties into user-defined units.

       The  Intensity  Calibration allows creating a mapping (correspondence) from
    monochrome image pixel values into user-defined units, for example  from  grey
    level into brightness, or grey level into density of material.

       The  Spatial  Calibration  allows  creating a mapping (correspondence) from
    pixel X,Y coordinates into a user-defined  H,V  coordinate  system.   The  H,V
    coordinates  may  be  translated,  scaled,  and/or rotated with respect to X,Y
    coordinates.

       The Histogram computes and displays a graph of an image's histogram.

       The Histogram Pair computes and displays a graph of the histogram  of  dif-
    ference of a pair of images.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The Mass & Moments computes and displays various moments of an image.

       The Line Profile displays a two-dimensional graph of pixels values along an
    arbitrary oriented line, arc, polyline, Bezier, and other curves.

       The Radial Mass Plot displays a two-dimensional graph of the sum  of  pixel
    values versus the pixels' distance from an origin.

       The  Ruler  overlays a ruler on the image, with user-defined length, width,
    and tick marks, all based on the H,V coordinate system.  Multiple  rulers  can
    be overlaid on each image.

       The  Protractor  overlays  a  protractor  on  the  image, with user-defined
    radius, arc, and tick marks, all based on the H,V coordinate system.  Multiple
    protractors can be overlaid on each image.

       The Cartesian Reticle overlays a Cartesian coordinate reticle on the image,
    based on the H,V coordinate system.  Multiple Cartesian reticles can be  over-
    laid on each image.

       The  Polar  Reticle overlays a polar coordinate reticle on the image, based
    on the H,V coordinate system.  Multiple polar reticles can be overlaid on each
    image.

       The  Distance  & Angle Crosshairs provides spatial calibration and measure-
    ment of absolute position, relative position, length and angles.  While  these
    capabilities  are also available elsewhere in Image Viewer - Measure and Image
    Viewer - Draw, the Distance & Angle Crosshairs  collects  chosen  features  to
    provide  a  single  window with the equivalent of a so-called `Video Crosshair
    Overlay & Measurement' system.

       The Shape Analysis provides  descriptive  statistics  about  the  shape  of
    elliptical, rectangular, or polygonal regions.

       The Blob Analysis identifies image blobs, based upon thresholding the image
    into foreground and background, and provides descriptive statistics about  the
    blobs found.

       The  Particle  Tracking  provides  identification and tracking of particles
    (blobs) over a sequence of images.  Individual particles  are  detected  based
    upon  a  thresholded  (bi-level)  image.  In one method, multiple image occur-
    rences of a common particle are identified across  a  sequence  of  images  by
    position  extrapolation and verification.  In a second method, vectors of par-
    ticles that are close together are compared and expected to  yield  consistent
    magnitude  and  direction.  In a third method, which requires the fewest setup
    parameters, common particles are grouped by nearest neighbor.  For any method,
    the particle's trajectories are displayed and reported.

       The SubPixel Edger overlays a line or curve tool on the image, analyzes the
    pixel values under the line or curve finding edges or lines to subpixel  accu-
    racy, and displays the position of the edges or lines both graphically, on the
    image, and numerically.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The Ellipse Fitter overlays an elliptical pattern of subpixel  edger  tools
    on the image, and computes a best-fit elliptical curve from the edges found.

       The Correlation Finder correlates, or matches, a kernel image over a larger
    image, showing the coordinates of, and  displaying  a  box  around,  the  best
    match(es).


    2.B.6  Image Viewer - Draw

       The  image  viewer window's Draw provides features for drawing graphics and
    text over the image.  One or more of: line, circle with aspect  ratio  correc-
    tion, rotated rectangle, rotated ellipse, arc of circle with aspect ratio cor-
    rection, arc of rotated ellipse, annulus, arc of annulus,  rectangular  frame,
    list  of  points, polygon, polyline (connected line segments not closed into a
    polygon), Bezier curve, or Bezier region (Bezier curve closed to form region),
    rotated  text,  and  arrow may be overlaid over the image (non destructive) or
    written into the image.  The individual menu items such as Text, Line, Rectan-
    gle,  etc.  allow quick drawing of graphics or text.  The Graphic Manager per-
    mits drawing the same graphics or text, but in  addition  manages  a  list  of
    graphic  or  text objects, including loading and saving of the graphic or text
    objects.

       The Image Overlay feature allows  overlaying  a  second  image,  containing
    graphics on a `transparent' background, over the current image.

       The  Paint  Brush feature allows interactive `painting' onto the image with
    selectable color, patterns, and `brush' shapes.

       The Paint Fill feature allows  filling  (flooding)  an  image  region  with
    `paint'  of selectable color and patterns, using specified pixel values as the
    boundary terminating the `filling'.


    2.B.7  Image Viewer - AOI

       The image viewer window's Aoi allows defining areas of interest  (AOI)  and
    regions  of  interest  (ROI)  upon which future image processing, measurement,
    analysis, print, load, and save features will operate.  As used  in  XCAP,  an
    `AOI'  is  a  rectangular area with sides parallel to the image axis, while an
    `ROI' is of arbitrary shape, such as an ellipse  or  rectangle  which  may  be
    rotated  with respect to the image axis, or an arbitrary path or polygon.  The
    image print, load, save, and many other features only allow  use  of  an  AOI;
    selected image processing, measurement, analysis and other features also allow
    use of an ROI.

       The Set AOI defines the default area of interest and color space upon which
    future image processing, printing, load, and save features will operate.

       The  Set  ROI  defines  the default region of interest and color space upon
    which future image measurement, analysis, and other  selected  features  which
    accept an ROI will operate.











    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       The  Set Full Image quickly sets the default area of interest and region of
    interest to the image's full dimensions, and the default color  space  to  the
    image  buffer's  natural  color space, without entering the Set AOI or Set ROI
    window.

       The AOI/ROI Manager maintains a list of often used areas of interest  (AOI)
    and regions of interest (ROI).

       Within  each  of  the image processing, measurement, analysis, print, load,
    and save features a different AOI (or ROI, if  applicable)  can  be  selected,
    temporarily  overriding the default AOI (or ROI).  Within the feature, the new
    AOI (or ROI) can be specified numerically or interactively drawn,  or  an  AOI
    (ROI) previously defined within the AOI/ROI Manager can be selected.


    2.B.8  Image Viewer - View - Shortcuts

       A tool bar of icons provides shortcuts for accessing often used features of
    The Image Viewer Window.  Selected shortcuts can  also  be  activated  by  key
    clicks  when  the  tool  bar  window has the `input focus' (i.e. that window's
    title bar is highlighted).  The shortcuts provided are:

      a.  Switch to first buffer of sequence (Key HOME).

      b.  Switch to next buffer of sequence (Key PAGE UP).

      c.  Switch to previous buffer of sequence (Key PAGE DOWN).

      d.  Switch to last buffer of sequence (Key END).

      e.  Copy image to new image buffer.

      f.  Adjust palette.

      g.  Activate or deactivate zoom (i.e. magnification).

      h.  Peek at numeric pixel values.

      i.  Activate or deactivate cursor overlay.

      j.  Draw a two-dimensional plot of line or column of pixel values.

      k.  Draw a histogram of pixel values.

      l.  Select: (a) Resizing of the image to fit The Image  Viewer  Window  with
          correct  aspect  ratio,  (b) No  resizing  so that there is a one to one
          relationship between an image pixel  and  a  graphics  display  system's
          pixel thereby avoiding resizing artifacts (although the entire image may
          not fit within the window and must therefore be panned and scrolled, and
          the  displayed  aspect  ratio  will be incorrect for images whose aspect
          ratio differs from  the  graphic  display  system's  aspect  ratio),  or
          (c) Resize  the image via pixel decimation or replication thereby avoid-
          ing resizing artifacts (although the  displayed  aspect  ratio  will  be










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


          incorrect for images whose aspect ratio differs from the graphic display
          system's aspect ratio).

    The first four shortcuts appear only  for  The  Image  Viewer  Window's  which
    access a sequence of images.

       The  shortcuts  may either be attached and part of The Image Viewer Window,
    or may be detached into its own window, as set by Display under Image Viewer -
    View.


    2.B.9  Image Viewer - View - Status Bar

       A  status bar provides information about the image resolution, current cur-
    sor coordinates, current buffer of a sequence, and other similar  information.
    The  information  to  be shown can be selected by Display under Image Viewer -
    View.


    2.B.10  PIXCI(R) Image Viewer - Capture

       The image viewer window associated with the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's  image
    frame  buffer(s)  has  Capture  which  provides  for capturing images from the
    PIXCI(R) frame grabber and other features associated with the  PIXCI(R)  frame
    grabber.   Any additional image viewer windows created by Launch 2nd Viewer do
    not provide Capture, but only view, modify, examine,  and/or  draw  the  frame
    buffers.

       The  Snap captures and displays a single image.  The Live continuously cap-
    tures and displays images; the UnLive terminates the Live mode, displaying the
    last captured image.

       The First Buffer switches to the first buffer of the frame buffer sequence,
    the Last Buffer switches to the last buffer of the frame buffer sequence,  the
    Next  Buffer switches to the next buffer of the frame buffer sequence, and the
    Previous Buffer switches to the previous buffer of the frame buffer sequence.

       The Adjustments allows setting common  adjustments,  as  suitable  for  the
    model  of  the PIXCI(R) frame grabber in use.  For the PIXCI(R) SV2, SV3, SV4,
    SV5, SV5A, SV5B, and SV5L models, the Adjustments allows selecting  the  video
    input  connection (N/A for PIXCI(R) SV5B) and adjusting the gain, black level,
    hue, and saturation.

       For the PIXCI(R) SV7  model,  the  Adjustments  allows  selecting  AGC  and
    adjusting the gain, black level, hue, and saturation.

       For  the  PIXCI(R) SV8  model,  the  Adjustments  allows  selecting AGC and
    adjusting the gain, black level, hue, saturation, and sharpness.

       For the PIXCI(R) A110 and A310 models, the Adjustments allows adjusting the
    analog  gain  and  offset,  and  the digital gain and offset.  Less frequently
    used, and more esoteric, adjustments may be found under PIXCI(R) Video  Setup,
    described above.  For the PIXCI(R) CL1, CL3SD, D, D24, D32, D2X, D3X, and D3XE










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    models, the Adjustments provide camera specific controls.

       For the PIXCI(R) CL2, E1,  E1DB,  E4,  E4DB,  E4G2-2F,  E4G2-4B,  E4G2-F2B,
    E4TX2-2F,  E4TX2-4B,  E4TX2-F2B,  E8,  E8DB, e104x4-2f, e104x4-4b, e104x4-f2b,
    EB1,  EB1G2,  EB1-PoCL,  EB1G2-PoCL,  EB1mini,  miniH2B,  miniH2F,  miniH2x4F,
    mf2280,  EC1, ECB1, ECB1-34, ECB2, EL1, and EL1DB models, the Adjustments pro-
    vide camera specific controls.   Or,  for  `Generic  Camera  Link'  mode,  the
    Adjustments  allow  configuring the PIXCI(R) frame grabber's video resolution,
    trigger modes, bit depth, color space, etc.  so as to be consistent  with  the
    camera.

       For the PIXCI(R) E8CAM, ELS2, SI, SI1, SI2, and SI4 models, the Adjustments
    provide camera specific controls.

       The Adjustments also provide duplicate  features  to  Snap,  Live,  UnLive,
    select the frame buffer, and set the video window size.  A duplicate menu item
    to access Adjustments is provided under Image Viewer - View.

       The Shortcuts activates or deactivates the PIXCI(R) Image Viewer -  Capture
    -  Shortcuts,  described  below.  A duplicate menu item to access Shortcuts is
    provided under Image Viewer - View.

       The GIO Event Capture provides single or sequence image capture, each image
    triggered  in  conjunction  with the frame grabber's general purpose (formerly
    referred to as an external TTL) input and output signals.

       The Sequence Capture features allow capturing a timed sequence  of  images.
    The  Sequence  Capture features may be started by an event (trigger), run con-
    tinuously until stopped by an event, or each individual image may be  captured
    in  response  to  an event.  Events include mouse clicks, time of day, and the
    frame grabber's general purpose (formerly referred to as external TTL) inputs;
    when  used with general purpose input events the Sequence Capture differs from
    GIO Event Capture in that the latter provides more options and higher accuracy
    and  repeatability for the manipulation of the general purpose inputs and out-
    puts in response to video timing.  A time stamp feature allows  recording  the
    time  that each image was captured, and either overlaying the time nondestruc-
    tively or permanently marking the image with the time.

       A variety of Sequence Capture features provide  tradeoffs  between  capture
    rate vs. convenience vs.  total number of images captured.  The Video to Frame
    Buffers captures sequences directly into pre-configured frame  buffer  memory,
    and can support any video rate or bandwidth.  The Video to Virtual Memory cap-
    tures and copies sequences into convenient dynamically allocated host computer
    (virtual)  memory,  but  may not support high video rate or bandwidth sequence
    capture for all cameras on all computers.  The Video to Disk File captures and
    copies sequences into a disk file in an efficient, internal format; after cap-
    ture the sequence can be saved in a standard format.  The Video to Image Files
    captures  and  copies sequences directly into standard format image files, but
    may not obtain as high video rate capture as the Video to Disk File feature.

       The Waterfall Display displays a chosen line of  the  frame  buffer,  in  a
    `waterfall'  fashion,  updating  the screen once per field, or as often as the
    host  computer's  speed  allows.   This  feature  is  primarily  intended  for










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    adjusting  line scan type cameras.  The waterfall display is intended only for
    viewing; it can't be analyzed, and can be saved  only  as  a  side  effect  of
    Screen Capture.

       The  Video  to StreamStor (only under Windows) allows recording and playing
    video to and from Boulder Instruments StreamStor  High-Speed  Disk  Recorders,
    allowing recording at video rate with almost all cameras and resolutions.  The
    Video to StreamStor is provided only in the XCAP-Plus version.

       The RGB Merge allows interpreting and  viewing  three  monochromatic  frame
    buffers  as a single color (e.g. RGB) image, with adjustments for registration
    and coloring.

       The Quad Pixel Merge allows interpreting  and  viewing  four  monochromatic
    frame  buffers, each one captured after shifting the image sensor by 1/2 pixel
    horizontally and vertically, as a single high resolution image.

       The Frame Average allows performing  recursive,  continuous,  averaging  of
    live video frames (or fields) and viewing the live result.

       The  Live  Options  combines  the View - Display options, above, with addi-
    tional choices governing Live mode.  During  Live  mode,  the  PIXCI(R)  frame
    grabber can: (a) Capture continuously into the specified frame buffer, however
    the image shown on the graphics display may contain  portions  from  different
    video  frames,  (b) Snap, display on the graphics display, and repeat, however
    the image capture and display rate will be slower, or (c) Alternate  capturing
    into  the  specified  frame buffer and the last frame buffer (dual buffering).
    On host computers with insufficient PCI bandwidth  to  simultaneously  capture
    into  host computer memory and display from host computer memory to the graph-
    ics display, option (b) reduces the required bandwidth by approximately half.

       The Lens Control - Birger EF232 allows controlling the aperture  and  focus
    of  a compatible lens via a Birger EF232 Lens Mount.  Both manual aperture and
    focus control, through the GUI, as well as automatic aperture and  focus  con-
    trol, in response to the image intensity and sharpness, are provided.


    2.B.11  PIXCI(R) Image Viewer - Capture - Shortcuts

       A tool bar of icons provides shortcuts for accessing often used features of
    the PIXCI(R) frame grabber, and is an extension of the Image Viewer -  View  -
    Shortcuts  described  above.   Selected shortcuts can also be activated by key
    clicks when the tool bar window has the  `input  focus'  (i.e.  that  window's
    title bar is highlighted).  The shortcuts provided are:

      a.  Switch to first buffer of frame buffer sequence (Key HOME).

      b.  Switch to next buffer of frame buffer sequence (Key PAGE UP).

      g.  Duplicate image.

      h.  Adjust palette.

      i.  Activate or deactivate zoom (i.e. magnification).

      j.  Activate or deactivate cursor overlay.

      k.  Select:  (a) Resizing  of  the image to fit The Image Viewer Window with
          correct aspect ratio, (b) No resizing so that there  is  a  one  to  one
          relationship  between  an  image  pixel  and a graphics display system's
          pixel thereby avoiding resizing artifacts (although the entire image may
          not fit within the window and must therefore be panned and scrolled, and
          the displayed aspect ratio will be incorrect  for  images  whose  aspect
          ratio  differs  from  the  graphic  display  system's  aspect ratio), or
          (c) Resize the image via pixel decimation or replication thereby  avoid-
          ing  resizing  artifacts  (although  the  displayed aspect ratio will be
          incorrect for images whose aspect ratio differs from the graphic display
          system's aspect ratio).

    2.C  Other Features

       Other useful features of XCAP are associated with many, or all, of its win-
    dows.

       Most windows of XCAP provide fields for numeric entry.  Typically,  to  the
    right  of the numeric entry field are two up/down or left/right buttons.  Left
    clicking a button allows incrementing or decrementing the numeric value.  Left
    clicking  within  a  button's shaded area yields larger increment or decrement
    values, depending on the distance from the opposite button.










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


       Right clicking the numeric field, either button, or the area  between  but-
    tons, yields an options menu.  The options menu typically provides the follow-
    ing:

      i.  Selecting the base to which integer numbers are displayed, or the format
          and precision to which non-integer numbers are displayed.

     ii.  Changing  the increment and decrement values to be applied when the but-
          tons are left clicked.  Selecting whether the increment or decrement  is
          added  or  subtracted, whether a percentage up or down, or is the number
          of `steps' unique to that numeric field.

    iii.  Activating a ScrollPad (a miniature scroll bar which overlays  the  dis-
          played  number)  allowing  adjustment  of  the  numeric value with mouse
          clicks and drags.

     iv.  Selecting units and range for display  of  angles,  such  as  0  to  360
          degrees,  -180  degrees to +180 degrees, 0 to 2pi radians, or -pi to +pi
          radians.

      v.  Selecting units for display of temporal intervals, such as milliseconds,
          seconds, minutes, or hours.

     vi.  Selecting  units  for  display of lengths, such as millimeters, centime-
          ters, meters, inches, or feet.

    vii.  Selecting units for display of frequencies, such  as  Hertz,  kiloHertz,
          megaHertz,  or  the  corresponding  period  in seconds, milliseconds, or
          microseconds.

    viii. Selecting units for display of memory sizes, such as  bytes,  kilobytes,
          megabytes, gigabytes, or IEC kibibytes, IEC mebibyte, IEC gibibyte, etc.

     ix.  Selecting units for display of temperature, such as Fahrenheit, Celsius,
          or Kelvin.

      x.  Connecting the field to receive new content from a specified cell of the
          Black Board, or connecting the field to transmit its content to a speci-
          fied cell of the Black Board.

     xi.  Providing a larger Big Field in which to view or enter a number.

    xii.  Providing an Expression field in which a mathematical expression can  be
          entered and evaluated to a numeric value.

    xiii. Providing editing controls such as Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete.

    Numeric  fields  which  only  display computed results, text entry fields, and
    text display fields, may provide some of the  above  options  --  accessed  by
    right clicking the field.

       Some  numeric  fields may have an associated, explicit, `slider' control in
    addition  to  the  implicit  ScrollPad.   Right  clicking  the  slider  allows










    ==== EPIX(R) =============================================================


    enlarging a portion of the slider's range for finer control.

       Various  windows of XCAP provide fields for entry of text, or file and path
    names.  Right clicking the field yields an options  menu.   The  options  menu
    typically provides the following:

      i.  Connecting the field to receive new content from a specified cell of the
          Black Board, or connecting the field to transmit its content to a speci-
          fied cell of the Black Board.

     ii.  Providing a larger Big Field in which to view or enter text.

    iii.  Providing a history of previously used values, allowing convenient reuse
          without retyping.

     iv.  Providing editing controls such as Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete.

      v.  Automatically generating a unique file  name  representing  the  current
          date and time (for files to be saved or created).

       Various  windows  of  XCAP provide fields for entry of pixel colors.  Typi-
    cally, the color can be  entered  numerically,  and  a  small  color  `swatch'
    appears  next  to  the  color  entry field, showing the selected color.  Right
    clicking the swatch activates a color cylinder from which new  colors  may  be
    selected by mouse clicks.

       Various  windows  of  XCAP provide a drop-down list selection field.  Right
    clicking the selection field yields an options menu which in turn  provides  a
    Search feature.  The Search allows convenient searching through a long list of
    selections.  Selected drop-down list selection fields may  have  an  explicit,
    adjacent, Search button to access the same service.

       For drop-down list selection fields used to select a serial `COM' port (for
    Windows) or `ttyS' device (for Linux),  right  clicking  the  selection  field
    yields  an options menu which in turn provides a Refresh feature which updates
    the list based on the operating system's currently installed ports or devices.

       Editing of numeric and text fields follows standard conventions.  In brief,
    mouse  click once or use left/right arrow keys to position the caret - charac-
    ters are inserted at the caret as typed.  Double mouse click to highlight  all
    text  or  single  click  and drag to highlight a portion of text - a Delete or
    Backspace removes the highlighted text, a character replaces  the  highlighted
    text, and the left/right arrow keys cancel the highlight mode.

       Hovering  the  mouse  over a numeric, text, list selection, checkbox, radio
    button, button, or other control will cause the associated Tool Tip,  if  any,
    to  pop-up;  the Tool Tip will automatically disappear.  The Tool Tip can also
    be displayed by right-clicking on the control for its options menu,  which  in
    turn provides a Tool Tip feature; the Tool Tip must be explicitly closed.  The
    Big Field, Expression, and Search features also display the Tool Tip.

       The user interface can be navigated without a mouse by using Tab and Shift-
    Tab  to  shift  input focus, arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn to scroll, arrow keys to

       Optionally,  if  XCAP  is  intended to be used solely in conjunction with a
    TWAIN compliant application or with Image-Pro, many of the  menu  features  of
    the  Main  Window and the PIXCI(R) Image Viewer Window may be removed so as to
    provide a simplified appearance (see Utilities -  Program  Setup).   The  same
    option  also  removes  several PIXCI(R) Image Viewer - Capture - Shortcuts and
    adds shortcuts duplicating features of  the  PIXCI(R)  -  TWAIN  Sourcery  and
    Image-Pro Sourcery.

       Notes:  (A) For  XCAP-Lite, the PIXCI(R) frame grabber is assumed installed
    and open for use, otherwise XCAP-Lite provides  the  same  features  as  XCAP-
    Viewer.   Use  of  XCAP-Plus, XCAP-Std, or XCAP-Ltd with missing authorization
    key provides the same features as XCAP-Lite.  Use of XCAP  without  activation

    code,  or  never having been configured for an authorization key, provides the
    features of XCAP-Viewer.
    (B) The Save, Import, and Export Graphic features are not available  in  XCAP-
    Viewer, XCAP-Lite, or XCAP-Ltd.
    (C) For  XCAP-Viewer,  images  may  not  be  saved;  images  may not be loaded
    directly from an Internet URL.  For XCAP-Lite, Save  Image  Sequence  is  only
    available in TIFF format; images may not be loaded directly from, or saved to,
    an Internet URL; and does not support image `stack' options.
    (D) For XCAP-Lite, the Sequence Capture to Image Files only supports TIFF for-
    mat.
    (E) The maximum amount of frame buffer memory is dependent on a the character-
    istics of the PIXCI(R) imaging card, the operating system, and of  XCAP  soft-
    ware.   The  PIXCI(R)  CL3SD  and SI2 have on-board frame buffer memory, other
    PIXCI(R) imaging cards use computer based frame buffer memory.   The  PIXCI(R)
    CL1,  CL2,  D,  D24, D32, D2X, D3X, SI, SV2, SV3, SV4, and SV5 are designed to
    access up to 4 GB of computer memory.  The  PIXCI(R)  A110,  A310,  D3XE,  E1,
    E1DB, E4, E4DB, E4G2-2F, E4G2-4B, E4G2-F2B, E4TX2-2F, E4TX2-4B, E4TX2-F2B, E8,

    ECB2, EL1, EL1DB, ELS2, SI1, SI4, SV7, and SV8 are designed to  access  up  to
    16 EiByte  of  computer memory (a theoretical limit, as no currently available
    computer system provides 16 EiByte of memory).  For XCAP-Lite,  a  maximum  of
    256 MiByte  of computer based frame buffer memory is supported (but allows one
    full resolution image buffer w/out size  restriction).   On  32  bit  systems,
    XCAP-Plus,  XCAP-Std,  and  XCAP-Ltd support up to 4 GiBytes of computer based
    frame buffer memory.  On 64 bit systems, XCAP-Plus and XCAP-Std supports up to
    16 EiByte  of  computer  based  frame  buffer  memory; XCAP-Ltd supports up to
    8 GiByte of computer based frame buffer memory.  The  maximum  available  com-
    puter based frame buffer memory is also limited by the computer hardware, con-
    figuration, and memory used by the operating system and other applications.
    (F) Camera specific controls provided for cameras supported by PIXCI(R) E8CAM,
    ELS2,  SI,  SI1,  SI2,  and  SI4,  and  for  many digital cameras supported by
